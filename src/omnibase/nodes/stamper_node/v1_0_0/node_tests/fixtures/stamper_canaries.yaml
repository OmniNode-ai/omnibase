# Canary file configuration for ONEX stamping safeguard
#
# This file lists the protocol-compliant test fixture files used as Canaries for preflight validation
# before any batch stamping operation. If any Canary fails protocol validation, the batch is aborted.
#
# Update this list as new filetypes are added or as protocol requirements evolve.
#
# Rationale: Prevents catastrophic batch corruption by surfacing protocol/handler/serialization errors early.
