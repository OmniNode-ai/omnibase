Pre-commit/CI hook: Enforce that all idempotency tests assert on uuid and created_at fields.

- Scans all test files for functions named test_*idempotency* or containing 'restamp'.
- Checks that these functions contain assertions on both uuid and created_at.
- Fails if any such test is missing the required assertions.

TODO: Implement full AST-based scan and assertion detection.
