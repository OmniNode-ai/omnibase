# OmniBase / ONEX

> **Status:** Bootstrap (Milestone 0)

OmniBase (ONEX) is the canonical execution, validation, and planning protocol for OmniNode-based systems. This repository provides the foundational scaffolding, protocols, CLI, and documentation for building, validating, and composing ONEX nodes.

## Project Summary
- **Purpose:** Establish a contract-first, metadata-driven execution model for composable, trust-aware nodes.
- **Scope:** This repository contains the ONEX CLI, protocol definitions, canonical templates, and documentation for node authors, tool builders, and runtime developers.

## Milestone 0: Bootstrap
- **Goal:** Provide the minimal infrastructure to support node discovery, validation, and CI integration.
- **Includes:**
  - Canonical directory structure
  - Protocol and registry stubs
  - CLI entrypoint (`onex`)
  - Example templates and schemas
  - Documentation for onboarding and architecture
