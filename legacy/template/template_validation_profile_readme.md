# Foundation Validation Profiles

This directory contains YAML validation profiles for the Foundation container. Profiles define validation rules, metadata, and orchestration for automated quality, compliance, and CI enforcement.

- Place all profile YAML files here (e.g., `python_foundation_profile.yaml`).
- Profiles must include a compliant OmniNode metadata block as specified in `docs/validation/validator_profile_system_md`.
- See the main checklist for required metadata fields and rule structure.
