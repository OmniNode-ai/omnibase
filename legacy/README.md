# Legacy Foundation Code

This directory contains legacy code from the previous foundation module. It is non-canonical and for migration only.

**Do not use in production or CI.**

Files will be ported, refactored, and removed from here as they are migrated to canonical locations following ONEX/OmniBase standards.
