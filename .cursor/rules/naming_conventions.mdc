# Cursor Rule: Naming Conventions

> **Status:** Canonical
> **Last Updated:** 2025-05-17

## Rule

All files, directories, and code artifacts in this repository must follow the naming conventions defined in [docs/standards.md](mdc:../../docs/standards.md). These conventions are mandatory for all contributors and enforced in code review and CI.

### Key Points
- **File/Directory Naming:** Use all-lowercase with underscores for Python files and directories. Prefix each filename with its parent directory or functional scope (e.g., `core_registry.py`, `protocol_registry.py`, `cli_validator.py`).
- **Reserved Prefixes:** Use `core_`, `protocol_`, `cli_`, `test_`, `template_`, and other reserved prefixes as defined in the standards document.
- **Test Files:** All test files must start with `test_`.
- **Templates:** All template files must start with `template_` and reside in a `templates/` directory.
- **CLI Tools:** CLI entrypoints must use the `cli_` prefix.
- **Schemas/Data:** Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names for YAML/JSON schema files.
- **No camelCase or PascalCase** in filenames except for legacy compatibility.
- **Versioning:** Use suffixes for versioned files (e.g., `registry_v1.py`).
- **No legacy_ prefix** unless staging for migration; files should be renamed to match standards as soon as they are ported.

### Enforcement
- Naming convention compliance is required for all PRs.
- Automated checks (linter or pre-commit hook) may be used to enforce this rule.
- Any deviation must be justified in the PR and reviewed by maintainers.

### Canonical Source
- The full, authoritative naming conventions are documented in [docs/standards.md](mdc:../../docs/standards.md). This rule is a summary; in case of conflict, the standards document prevails.
