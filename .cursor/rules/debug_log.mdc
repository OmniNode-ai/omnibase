# Cursor Rule: Debug Log Format and Process

> **Status:** Canonical
> **Last Updated:** 2025-05-18

## Rule

All debugging activity for this repository must be documented in a daily, cumulative debug log, following the canonical template and process below. This ensures traceability, reviewability, and knowledge transfer for all engineering and debugging work.

### Key Points
- **Weekly, Cumulative Log:**
  - All debug logs must be organized by week (Mondayâ€“Sunday) and engineer, e.g., `docs/dev_logs/<engineer>/debug_log_YYYY_MM_DD.md`.
  - Each log must cover all debugging sessions for the week, with daily sections and timestamped entries.
  - Each log must begin with a YAML metadata block (log_owner, week, repo_version, created_at, tags) for future parsing and search.
- **Template Compliance:**
  - All debug logs must use the canonical template: `src/omnibase/templates/debug_log.tmpl`.
  - Each entry must include: timestamp, engineer, tags, context, problem statement, hypotheses, investigation steps, findings, next steps.
  - Timestamps and engineer names should be auto-inserted if possible (see CLI/script guidance).
  - Logs must be detailed, reviewable, and suitable for future reference and onboarding.
- **Alignment with Velocity Log:**
  - Debug logs must match the structure, granularity, and reviewability of velocity logs.
  - Weekly summary section required: engineers, major issues, key solutions, blockers, next steps.
- **Tagging:**
  - Each debug entry must include a tags field (e.g., #blocker, #infra, #regression) for filtering and summarization.
- **Update Policy:**
  - Debug logs must be updated as investigation proceeds, not retroactively.
  - All major discoveries, dead ends, and solutions must be logged.
- **Rotation/Archival:**
  - At the end of each quarter or milestone, logs must be rolled up for archival (see docs/future_enhancements.md).
- **Review and Enforcement:**
  - Debug log compliance is required for all PRs involving significant debugging or protocol changes.
  - Any deviation must be justified in the PR and reviewed by maintainers.

### Canonical Source
- The canonical template is `src/omnibase/templates/debug_log.tmpl`.
- Archival policy and enhancements are tracked in `docs/future_enhancements.md`.
- This rule is a summary; in case of conflict, the template or architectural decision records prevail.
