# VELOCITY LOG ENTRY RULE

## Purpose
Defines the canonical, authoritative format for daily or batch velocity log entries in the OmniBase/ONEX project. Ensures all progress, actions, and outcomes are recorded in a reviewable, versionable, and extendable manner. This rule is to be followed for all velocity log creation requests.

## Required Sections & Fields
Each velocity log entry MUST include the following sections and fields:

- **Date**: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Velocity Report Title**: Short summary of the day's/batch's focus
- **Metadata Block**:
  - `velocity_log_id`: Unique UUID (or similar) for this log entry
  - `parent_log_id`: UUID of the previous log entry (or null for first entry)
  - `Score`: Integer or percentage (e.g., 93/100)
  - `Lines Changed`: "+X / -Y" (insertions/deletions)
  - `Files Modified`: Integer
  - `Time Spent`: Duration (e.g., "1 day")
  - `Velocity Metric`: Qualitative summary (e.g., High, Medium, Low, with context)
- **Key Achievements**: Bulleted, grouped by area (e.g., Registry, Test Coverage, Documentation)
- **Prompts & Actions (Chronological)**: Timestamped, agent-attributed log of actions, with unique IDs
- **Major Milestones Today**: Bulleted summary of most important outcomes
- **Blockers / Next Steps**: Explicit list of unresolved issues and future actions
- **Related Issues/Tickets**: (Optional) List of issue IDs or links closed/resolved by this work
- **Breaking Changes**: (Optional) Any changes that require migration or special attention
- **Migration/Upgrade Notes**: (Optional) Steps required for users after this work
- **Documentation Impact**: (Optional) What docs were updated or need updating
- **Test Coverage**: (Optional) Summary of new/updated tests, coverage delta
- **Security/Compliance Notes**: (Optional) Any relevant security, privacy, or compliance considerations
- **Reviewer(s)**: (Optional) Who reviewed or approved the work
- **Velocity Log Reference**: (Optional) Reference to associated PR description if one exists

## Field Definitions
- All fields are REQUIRED unless otherwise noted.
- Timestamps: ISO 8601 with timezone (e.g., 2025-05-05T09:15:00-04:00)
- Log IDs: Use UUIDv4 or similar unique identifier
- Agent: Name or handle of the person or bot responsible for the action
- For batch (multi-day) logs, repeat the template for each day in chronological order.

## Output Format
All velocity logs MUST be written in Markdown, using the following template:

---

# Velocity Tracking (<date range>)

## Daily Progress Tracking

### <YYYY-MM-DD>

# Velocity Report: <Short Title> (<YYYY-MM-DD>)

- velocity_log_id: <uuid>
- parent_log_id: <uuid or null>
- **Score:** <score>
- **Lines Changed:** <+X / -Y>
- **Files Modified:** <int>
- **Time Spent:** <duration>
- **Velocity Metric:** <qualitative summary>

### Key Achievements
- <bulleted grouped achievements>

### Prompts & Actions (Chronological)
- [<timestamp>] <emoji> <action summary> (id: <short_id>, agent: "<name>")

### Major Milestones Today

### Blockers / Next Steps
- <bulleted list>

### Related Issues/Tickets (Optional)
- <list or 'None'>

### Breaking Changes (Optional)
- <list or 'None'>

### Migration/Upgrade Notes (Optional)
- <notes or 'None'>

### Documentation Impact (Optional)
- <notes or 'None'>

### Test Coverage (Optional)
- <summary or 'None'>

### Security/Compliance Notes (Optional)
- <notes or 'None'>

## Special Notes
- Each entry is considered authoritative upon creation.
- No legacy migration is required for new codebases.
- For batch entries, repeat the template for each day in the range.
