# PULL REQUEST (PR) DESCRIPTION RULE

## Template
All PR descriptions **must** use the canonical template at:
`src/omnibase/templates/dev_logs/template_pr_description.md`

## Stamping
All PR description files **must** be stamped with an ONEX metadata block at the top, using the same handler/mixin logic as debug and velocity logs. Stamping must be idempotent and policy-driven.

## Location & Naming
- All PR descriptions must be saved in `docs/dev_logs/<user>/pr/`.
- Filename must be: `pr_description_<YYYY_MM_DD>_pr<PRNUMBER>.md` (e.g., `pr_description_2025_05_21_pr1234.md`).

## Required Sections & Fields
Each PR description MUST include the following sections and fields:

- **PR Title**: Short, descriptive summary
- **Branch**: Source → target (e.g., feature/foo → main)
- **PR ID or Link**: (Optional) Unique identifier or URL for the PR
- **Summary of Changes**: 1–2 sentence overview
- **Key Achievements**: Bulleted, grouped by area (e.g., Registry, Test Coverage, Documentation)
- **Prompts & Actions (Chronological)**: Timestamped, agent-attributed log of actions, with unique IDs if available
- **Major Milestones**: Bulleted summary of most important outcomes
- **Blockers / Next Steps**: Explicit list of unresolved issues and future actions
- **Metrics**:
  - `Lines Changed`: "+X / -Y" (insertions/deletions)
  - `Files Modified`: Integer
  - `Time Spent`: Duration (if tracked)
- **Related Issues/Tickets**: (Optional) List of issue IDs or links closed/resolved by this PR
- **Breaking Changes**: (Optional) Any changes that require migration or special attention
- **Migration/Upgrade Notes**: (Optional) Steps required for users after merge
- **Documentation Impact**: (Optional) What docs were updated or need updating
- **Test Coverage**: (Optional) Summary of new/updated tests, coverage delta
- **Security/Compliance Notes**: (Optional) Any relevant security, privacy, or compliance considerations
- **Reviewer(s)**: (Optional) Who is expected to review/approve
- **Release Notes Snippet**: (Optional) Suggested changelog entry

## Field Definitions
- All fields are REQUIRED unless otherwise noted.
- Timestamps: ISO 8601 with timezone (e.g., 2025-05-05T09:15:00-04:00)
- Agent: Name or handle of the person or bot responsible for the action
- For multi-feature PRs, group achievements and actions by feature or area if possible.

## Output Format
All PR descriptions MUST be written in Markdown, using the canonical template (see above).

---

## Rationale
This ensures all PR descriptions are:
- Traceable and auditable
- Consistently formatted and metadata-stamped
- Easy to locate and review
- Compatible with ONEX provenance and observability standards

## Enforcement
- Directory and naming compliance is enforced. PR descriptions not following this rule will be rejected in review.
- Automated checks may be used to enforce this rule.
- Any deviation must be justified in the PR and reviewed by maintainers.

## Special Notes
- Each PR description is considered authoritative upon creation.
- All descriptions must be reviewable, versionable, and extendable.
- Do not omit any required section or field.
- Optional fields should be included when relevant; otherwise, state 'None'.
- The PR description should be scoped only to the changes in the branch being merged.
