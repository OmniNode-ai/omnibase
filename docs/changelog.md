## Versioning Guidelines

### Semantic Versioning Rules

1. **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
3. **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

### Pre-release Versions
- **Alpha** (X.Y.Z-alpha.N): Early development, unstable
- **Beta** (X.Y.Z-beta.N): Feature complete, testing phase
- **RC** (X.Y.Z-rc.N): Release candidate, final testing

### Version Numbering Examples
```
1.0.0        # Major release
1.1.0        # Minor release with new features
1.1.1        # Patch release with bug fixes
2.0.0-alpha.1  # Pre-release alpha version
2.0.0-beta.1   # Pre-release beta version
2.0.0-rc.1     # Release candidate
```
