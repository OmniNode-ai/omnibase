### Implemented Features (v1.0.0)

- **Core Event Schema**: Standardized `OnexEvent` model with required fields
- **Event Types**: Node lifecycle and telemetry operation events
- **Metadata Standards**: Structured metadata schemas for each event type
- **Schema Validation**: Comprehensive validation with strict/non-strict modes
- **Telemetry Integration**: Event emission integrated into telemetry system
- **Documentation**: Complete specification and implementation guidelines

### Current Limitations

1. **No Event Versioning**: Schema changes require careful coordination
2. **Limited Error Classification**: Basic error handling without structured codes
3. **No Performance Profiling**: Limited performance analysis capabilities
4. **Basic Correlation**: Simple correlation IDs without hierarchical relationships
5. **No Event Sampling**: All events emitted regardless of volume
6. **No Event Replay**: Limited debugging capabilities for complex issues

## Proposed Enhancements

### Phase 1: Core Improvements (Target: v1.1.0)

#### 1. Event Schema Versioning

**Problem**: Schema evolution requires breaking changes and complex migration procedures.

**Solution**: Add schema versioning to enable backward-compatible evolution.

```python
class OnexEvent(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields
    schema_version: str = Field(default="1.1.0", description="Event schema version")
```

**Benefits**:
- Enables gradual schema migration
- Supports multiple schema versions simultaneously
- Provides compatibility checking

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Low

#### 2. Standardized Error Codes

**Problem**: Error handling lacks structured classification for automated processing.

**Solution**: Implement hierarchical error code system.

```python
class OnexErrorCode(str, Enum):
    STAMP_FILE_NOT_FOUND = "ONEX_STAMP_001"
    VALIDATE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH = "ONEX_VALIDATE_002"
    # ... more codes
```

**Benefits**:
- Enables automated error classification
- Improves alerting and monitoring
- Facilitates error pattern analysis

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Low

#### 3. Enhanced Correlation Tracking

**Problem**: Current correlation tracking is flat and doesn't support hierarchical relationships.

**Solution**: Add parent/child correlation relationships and distributed tracing integration.

```python
class OnexEvent(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields
    parent_correlation_id: Optional[str] = None
    trace_id: Optional[str] = None
```

**Benefits**:
- Enables cross-node operation tracing
- Supports distributed tracing standards
- Improves debugging capabilities

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Medium

### Phase 2: Performance & Scalability (Target: v1.2.0)

#### 4. Event Sampling Configuration

**Problem**: High-frequency events can overwhelm the event system in production.

**Solution**: Implement configurable sampling rates for different event types.

```python
class EventSampler:
    def __init__(self, sample_rates: Dict[OnexEventTypeEnum, float]):
        self.sample_rates = sample_rates
    
    def should_emit(self, event_type: OnexEventTypeEnum) -> bool:
        rate = self.sample_rates.get(event_type, 1.0)
        return random.random() < rate
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces event bus load in production
- Maintains observability while controlling volume
- Configurable per event type

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Medium

#### 5. Event Batching Support

**Problem**: Individual event emission can be inefficient for high-volume scenarios.

**Solution**: Implement event batching with configurable limits.

```python
class EventBatcher:
    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 100, max_age_ms: int = 1000):
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.max_age_ms = max_age_ms
    
    def add_event(self, event: OnexEvent):
        # Batch events and flush when limits reached
        pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Improved throughput and reduced network overhead
- Better resource utilization
- Configurable batching parameters

**Implementation Effort**: High
**Risk**: Medium

#### 6. Event Size Optimization

**Problem**: Large events can impact performance and storage.

**Solution**: Implement compression and size limits for large events.

**Benefits**:
- Better performance and resource utilization
- Automatic compression for large events
- Size validation and warnings

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Low

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Target: v1.3.0)

#### 7. Event Replay Capability

**Problem**: Debugging complex issues requires the ability to replay event sequences.

**Solution**: Implement event storage and replay functionality.

```python
class EventReplaySystem:
    def record_event(self, event: OnexEvent):
        # Store event for replay
        pass
    
    def replay_events(self, correlation_id: str, speed_multiplier: float = 1.0):
        # Replay events for debugging
        pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Time-travel debugging capabilities
- Issue reproduction and analysis
- Testing and validation support

**Implementation Effort**: High
**Risk**: Medium

#### 8. Performance Profiling Events

**Problem**: Limited performance analysis capabilities within the event system.

**Solution**: Add specialized events for performance profiling.

```python
class PerformanceProfileEvent(OnexEvent):
    event_type: Literal[OnexEventTypeEnum.PERFORMANCE_PROFILE]
    metadata: PerformanceProfileMetadata
```

**Benefits**:
- Detailed performance insights
- No dependency on external profiling tools
- Integrated performance monitoring

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Low

#### 9. Event-Driven Alerting

**Problem**: Manual monitoring and alerting configuration is error-prone.
