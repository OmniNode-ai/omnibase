# Metadata Validation & CLI

See the [Metadata Specification](../metadata.md) for the canonical overview and field definitions.

## CLI Validation

The OmniBase CLI provides commands for validating and inspecting metadata blocks:

```bash
omnibase validate metadata <path_or_uuid>
```
Performs:
- Schema validation
- Type enforcement
- Version rule compliance
- Dependency resolution checks
- Graph cycle detection

Other CLI examples:
```bash
omnibase inspect metadata validator_abc
omnibase visualize dependencies tool_xyz
```

---

## Schema Enforcement

- All registered components must have valid metadata
- Schema-validated via Pydantic
- Enforced in CLI and CI
- Non-conforming entries are rejected at the registry level

---

## CI Integration

- Metadata validation should be part of the continuous integration pipeline
- Failures in schema, type, or dependency checks block merges
- Planned: automated metadata diffing and patching in CI

---

## Planned Validation Tooling

- [ ] Metadata diff viewer
- [ ] Inferred metadata from component introspection
- [ ] Metadata explorer UI
- [ ] Pydantic-backed schema generation for static validation
