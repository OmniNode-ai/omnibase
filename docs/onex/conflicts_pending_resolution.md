# ONEX v0.1 Conflicts Pending Resolution

> **Purpose:** This document records any conflicts, ambiguities, or unresolved issues found during the integration of ONEX v0.1 canonical specifications into the OmniBase documentation. Each entry should reference the affected files/sections and provide a brief description of the issue.

---

## [2025-05-16] Initial Integration Batch

- **docs/structured_testing.md**: The ONEX validator protocol/result model section was already present and matched the ONEX v0.1 version. No conflict found.
- **docs/metadata.md, docs/registry.md, docs/structured_testing.md**: No direct conflicts detected in this batch. All ONEX v0.1 content was inserted as canonical sections with explicit supersession notes.

---

> Use this file to record any future conflicts or ambiguities discovered during ONEX v0.1 integration or subsequent updates.
