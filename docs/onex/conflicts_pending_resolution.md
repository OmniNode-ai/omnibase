## [2025-05-16] Initial Integration Batch

- **docs/structured_testing.md**: The ONEX validator protocol/result model section was already present and matched the ONEX v0.1 version. No conflict found.
- **docs/metadata.md, docs/registry.md, docs/structured_testing.md**: No direct conflicts detected in this batch. All ONEX v0.1 content was inserted as canonical sections with explicit supersession notes.
