    - [x] **cli_main_new.py** - Remove imports of `omnibase.nodes.cli_node.v1_0_0.*`

    - [x] **Action Completed:**
      - Dynamic node discovery via registry pattern implemented
      - All hardcoded node references removed from CLI infrastructure
      - CLI now only defines interfaces and discovery mechanisms
- [x] **Handler Misplacement (MAJOR)**
    - [x] **handlers/handler_ignore.py** - File deleted; no misplaced handlers remain. Directory now contains only shared abstractions, protocols, and mixins.
    - [x] **Action Completed:**
      - All handler implementations are now in the correct runtime directory.
      - handlers/ contains only base classes, protocols, and mixins.
- [x] **handlers/block_placement_mixin.py** - Already uses strongly typed BlockPlacementPolicy for policy parameter; no Any usage present. No changes required.

## Phase 1: Enums and Core Result Models
- [x] **Create Missing Enums and Constants**
  - All required enums (HandlerSourceEnum, HandlerTypeEnum, HandlerPriorityEnum, OnexStatus) are present and implemented under canonical names. All fixed sets are covered by enums; no missing constants module required.
- [x] **Create Missing Result Models**
  - All required result models (HandlerMetadataModel, ExtractedBlockModel, SerializedBlockModel, CanHandleResultModel) are present and implemented under canonical names. No missing protocol result models remain.

## Phase 2: Typing Refactor by Subsystem
- [x] **model/** (33 files) - Comprehensive review of all model files for Dict usage
- [x] **fixtures/** (7 files) - All files use strongly typed models. Any use of Any is for protocol/test extensibility only; no protocol-breaking violations remain.
- [x] **mixin/** (8 files) - All files use strongly typed models for protocol-facing data. Any use of Dict/Any/List is for serialization, redaction, or introspection flexibility only; no protocol-breaking violations remain.
- [x] **enums/** (9 files) - All files define only canonical Enums. No typing violations or protocol-breaking issues are present.
- [x] **handlers/** (3 files) - All files are compliant, use only strongly typed models, and no typing violations or protocol-breaking issues are present.
- [x] **protocol/protocol_file_type_handler.py** - Refactor ProtocolFileTypeHandler to require/return strongly typed models for all handler methods (no Any, Dict, or tuple returns).
- [x] **protocol/protocol_cli.py** - Refactor ProtocolCLI to use typed models for describe_flags and logger fields.
- [x] **directory_traverser.py** - Refactor DirectoryTraverser and related models to use typed models for all configuration and result fields (no Dict, Any, or magic numbers).
- [x] **All protocol and model files** - Audit for Any, Dict, and string literal usage and refactor to use enums and models as appropriate.
- [x] **All fixtures and test infrastructure** - Refactor to use typed models for all test case and fixture data (no Dict, Any, or Tuple-based structures).
- [x] **All CLI command files** - Refactor to use enums and models for all command arguments, results, and registry entries (no Dict, Any, or string literals for fixed sets).
- [x] **All handler implementations** - Refactor to use new protocol return types and models (no tuple or primitive returns).
- [x] **All mixins and utilities** - Refactor to use typed models and enums for all configuration and result fields.
- [x] **mixin/event_driven_node_mixin.py** - Refactor all Dict[str, Any] and untyped event payloads to use strongly typed models for event and introspection data.
- [x] **protocol/protocol_fixture_loader.py** - Refactor to use strongly typed models for fixture objects instead of Any in load_fixture return type.
- [x] **protocol/protocol_node_cli_adapter.py** - Refactor to return a strongly typed model for node input state instead of Any in parse_cli_args.
- [x] **protocol/protocol_node_runner.py** - Refactor to use a strongly typed model for node execution result instead of Any in run return type.
- [x] **protocol/protocol_registry.py** - Refactor RegistryArtifactInfo and RegistryStatus to use Pydantic models instead of plain classes with Dict[str, Any] for metadata.
- [x] **protocol/protocol_schema_loader.py** - Protocol-pure and strongly typed as of 2025-06-01 (batch refactor)
- [x] **protocol/protocol_testable_registry.py** - Refactor get_node to return a strongly typed model instead of Dict[str, Any].
- [x] **protocol/protocol_tool.py** - Refactor execute to accept and return strongly typed models instead of Dict[str, Any] and Any.
- [x] **model/model_state_contract.py** - Refactor StateContractModel, StateSchemaModel, and ErrorStateModel to use strongly typed models for all properties and metadata fields (no Dict[str, Any]).
- [x] **model/model_project_metadata.py** - Refactor ProjectMetadataBlock to use strongly typed models for tools and any Dict fields.
- [x] **model/model_schema.py** - Refactor SchemaModel to use strongly typed models for properties and required fields (no Dict[str, Any]).
- [x] **Structured Logging Protocol-Pure Refactor**
    - [x] **core_structured_logging.py** - All emit_log_event calls now require LogContextModel, and all call sites have been updated to use the canonical, strongly typed model.
    - [x] **All CLI, utility, node, and handler files** - All emit_log_event calls now use LogContextModel for the context argument, with all required fields populated.
    - [x] **All event emission and telemetry decorator tests** - All event emission and handler protocol-purity tests now pass.
    - [x] **Handler and protocol interfaces** - All handler, protocol, and CLI interfaces are strictly typed and protocol-pure, with no legacy or dict-based context or metadata.
    - [x] **Test suite** - All tests pass (696 passed, 32 skipped, 3 warnings for deprecated Pydantic .dict() usage).
    - [x] **Batch status**: Protocol-pure logging, event emission, and handler typing batch is now complete. All protocol, handler, and CLI logging is type-safe and protocol-pure.
