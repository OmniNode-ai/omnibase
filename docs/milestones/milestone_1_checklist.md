### Test Canonicalization and Protocol-Driven Refactor
- [ ] **Handler/Fixture/Integration Test Separation and Coverage**
    - [ ] All test cases (node-local, handler, integration, fixture) must be generated or injected via protocol-driven registries or handler serialization methods.
    - [ ] Assertions must be model-based or handler-driven, never string-based for domain fields.
    - [ ] All test parameterization must use protocol-driven registries or fixtures.
    - [ ] All test files must be reviewed for: no hardcoded domain values, no string-based assertions for domain fields, no parallel or ad-hoc logic for metadata block construction or parsing, full round-trip and idempotency coverage using handler logic.
    - [ ] Refactor node-local tests to use only in-memory, protocol-driven, handler-rendered test cases (no file-based fixtures for canonical/positive cases)
    - [ ] Add/expand handler-level tests in `tests/handlers/` to cover: file-based fixture parsing, edge cases and malformed files, delimiter/comment handling and legacy file support
    - [ ] Add/expand integration tests in `tests/tools/` or `tests/fixtures/` to cover: CLI and disk-backed stamping flows, end-to-end stamping and validation with real files, negative/malformed file scenarios
    - [ ] Ensure all handler/fixture/integration tests are separated from node-local protocol tests
    - [ ] Document the separation and rationale in `docs/testing/node_testing_guidelines.md` and `docs/testing/fixtures_guidelines.md`
    - [ ] 80% test coverage minimum for all files
    - [ ] No hardcoded dependencies or singletons
- [x] **Node audit. Make sure all nodes match. Several are missing contracts. That should fail the parity node test. we should consider .onextrees for all nodes which could also be emitted during introspection and use that to test node homogeniaty**
    - **DoD:** All nodes have required manifests and pass parity validation
    - **Artifact:** Complete node.onex.yaml manifests for all 7 nodes
    - **Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Added missing node.onex.yaml manifest for schema_generator_node. All 7 nodes now have required manifests. Parity validator shows 35 passed validations with SUCCESS status.
- [ ] **Naming convention audit for all files**
    - **DoD:** All files follow canonical naming conventions with proper prefixes
    - **Artifact:** Renamed files and updated imports
    - **Status:** üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete: Moved 2 misplaced protocol files from fixtures/ to protocol/. Next: Fix missing prefixes in core/ and tools/ directories.
- [ ] **Protocol-Driven File I/O in Tests**
    - [ ] Audit all test files for direct use of `open`, `Path`, `write_text`, `yaml.safe_load`, `json.load`, and similar.
    - [ ] Refactor all file I/O in tests to use protocol-driven adapters (e.g., `InMemoryFileIO`, `ProtocolFileIO`).
    - [ ] Ensure all test data loading and writing is abstracted and testable via protocol.
- [ ] **Canonical Models and Enums for Test Data**
    - [ ] Identify all test case definitions using `dict`, `str`, or lists of tuples.
    - [ ] Replace with canonical Pydantic models and imported Enums for all test case structures.
    - [ ] Refactor test case IDs, types, and expected results to use Enums, not string literals.
- [ ] **Test Case Injection via Registry**
    - [ ] Implement or update a protocol-driven test case registry (e.g., `ProtocolCLIDirFixtureRegistry`).
    - [ ] Refactor all test modules to use injectable, registry-driven test cases.
    - [ ] Remove all hardcoded test data from test modules; import or inject from the registry.
- [ ] **Handler-Driven Parsing and Serialization**
    - [ ] Audit all test code for direct calls to `yaml.safe_load`, `json.load`, or similar.
    - [ ] Refactor all parsing/serialization to use the canonical handler registry.
    - [ ] Ensure all edge cases, delimiters, and legacy file support are covered by handler logic.
- [ ] **Assertions and Output Validation**
    - [ ] Identify all string-based asserts (e.g., `assert "foo" in result`).
    - [ ] Replace with model-based or Enum-based assertions using canonical result models.
    - [ ] Ensure all output validation is standards-compliant and robust to model changes.
- [ ] **Separation of Test Types**
    - [ ] Node-local tests: Refactor to use only in-memory, protocol-driven, handler-rendered test cases.
    - [ ] Handler-level tests: Move or expand file-based fixture parsing, edge case, and delimiter tests to `tests/handlers/`.
    - [ ] Integration tests: Move or expand CLI/disk-backed, end-to-end, and negative/malformed file tests to `tests/tools/` or `tests/fixtures/`.
    - [ ] Document and enforce the separation in `docs/testing/node_testing_guidelines.md` and `docs/testing/fixtures_guidelines.md`.
- [ ] **Documentation and Rationale**
    - [ ] Update or create documentation for: the rationale and structure for each test type, the protocol-driven approach to test data and I/O, the registry-driven test case injection pattern.
    - [ ] Reference all canonical models, Enums, and handler registries in documentation.
    - [ ] Add migration notes and before/after examples for maintainers.
- [ ] **CI and Enforcement**
    - [ ] Add or update CI checks to enforce: no direct file I/O or serialization in tests (except via protocol), no hardcoded string literals for test case IDs, types, or results, all test cases are registry-injectable and model-driven.
    - [ ] Add linter or static analysis rules to flag non-canonical patterns.
    - [ ] Ensure all new and refactored tests pass and are covered by CI.
- [ ] **Review and Finalization**
    - [ ] Review all refactored test modules for compliance with project standards and naming conventions.
    - [ ] Cross-reference checklist items with milestone and documentation artifacts.
    - [ ] Solicit review from maintainers and update checklist status accordingly.
- [ ] **Add/Update CI checks for naming and file size**
    - **DoD:** CI fails on non-canonical names or oversized files.
    - **Artifact:** CI config, linter rules.
- [ ] **[Optional Stretch Goal] Prototype f2n (Function-to-Node) and node_announce event schema**
    - **DoD:** Minimal f2n utility and event schema defined; see docs/future_enhancements.md for spec.
    - **Artifact:** Prototype code, event schema, and documentation.

### Deferred Items
- [ ] Reducer snapshot test (deferred)
    - **Note:** Deferred until reducer protocol is fully specified in M2. See `tests/protocol/test_reducer_snapshot.py` for stub.

  - Canonical metadata and tags
  - Complete node schema alignment
- [ ] Run CI parity validator and verify:
  - Metadata hashes match stamped content
  - CLI parity and validation tests pass across nodes
- [ ] Validate directory layout:
  - All runnable nodes live in `src/omnibase/nodes/`
  - Helper files reside in clearly scoped `helpers/` directories
- [ ] Run final linter/type checks:
  - `ruff`, `mypy`, `yamllint`, `black` if applicable
  - No warnings or untyped public methods
- [ ] Confirm final commit includes updated `README.md` or docs if directory changes were made
- [ ] Replace all hardcoded strings with enums, constants or modelproperty.value
