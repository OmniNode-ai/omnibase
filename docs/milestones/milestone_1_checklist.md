# Milestone 1 Implementation Checklist: ONEX Node Protocol, Schema, Metadata, and CI Enforcement

## üîÅ RECOMMENDED EXECUTION PLAN (Refactor-Minimizing Order)

The following sequence is optimized to minimize refactor overhead and test breakage, based on the current state of architecture, typing debt, and test coverage (682 tests as of review).

### 1. Phase 0: Fix All Architecture Violations (Blocking)
- Freeze all typing and test changes until these are resolved.
- Address critical violations across `core/`, `shared models/`, `cli/`, and `runtimes/`.
- Validate fix with parity validator and CI.


- [ ] **Event-Driven Node Discovery and Registry Node (CRITICAL)**
    - [x] **Define Node Announcement Protocol**
        - Specify the event schema for `node_announce` messages (required fields: node_id, metadata_block, status, execution_mode, inputs, outputs, graph_binding, etc.).
        - Add protocol documentation and canonical example to core/protocol.
        - **DoD:** Protocol and schema for node_announce event are defined and documented in core.
    - [x] **Refactor Core for Protocol Purity**
        - Remove all runtime/node imports and discovery logic from core (e.g., no `RuntimeHandlerDiscovery` import).
        - Require all handler/node discovery to occur via event-driven registration or plugin mechanisms.
        - **DoD:** Core contains only protocol definitions and abstract interfaces; no runtime/node dependencies.
    - [x] **Implement CollectorNode (Registry Node) in Runtime/Nodes**
        - Scaffold a CollectorNode that subscribes to the event bus and maintains a live registry of all nodes (ephemeral and persistent).
        - CollectorNode must handle node_announce events, maintain node status, and provide lookup for agents/schedulers.
        - **DoD:** CollectorNode is implemented as a runtime/node service, not in core; can receive and track node_announce events.
    - [~] **Document Event-Driven Registration Pattern**
        - Update developer documentation to require all nodes (including ephemeral/function-wrapped) to emit node_announce on startup.
        - Provide migration guidance for moving from static to event-driven registration.
        - **DoD:** Documentation and migration guide are published.

- [ ] **Core Layer Architecture Violations (CRITICAL)**
    - [x] **core_file_type_handler_registry.py** - Remove imports of specific runtime handlers (lines 37-50)
    - [x] **core_structured_logging.py** - Remove import of `omnibase.nodes.logger_node.v1_0_0.models.state` (line ~175)
        - No such import present; file is already protocol-pure.
    - [ ] **Action Required:** 
      - Implement plugin-based discovery pattern for handlers
      - Use dependency injection for logger state access
      - Core layer must only define protocols and abstract base classes
    - **DoD:** Core layer has zero imports from nodes/ or runtimes/
    - **Priority:** BLOCKING - affects all downstream functionality
    - **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

- [x] **Shared Model Architecture Violations (CRITICAL)**
    - [x] **model_node_metadata.py** - Remove import of omnibase.nodes.stamper_node.v1_0_0.node_tests.stamper_test_registry_cases (line 888)
    - [x] **Action Required:**
      - Move test registry cases to shared test infrastructure
      - Use dependency injection pattern for test case access
      - Shared models must not import from specific nodes
    - **DoD:** All shared models have zero imports from nodes/
    - **Priority:** BLOCKING - affects metadata handling across ecosystem
    - **Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

- [ ] **CLI Infrastructure Architecture Violations (CRITICAL)**
    - [ ] **cli_main.py** - Remove hardcoded `stamper_node@v1_0_0` registry entry
    - [ ] **cli_main_new.py** - Remove imports of `omnibase.nodes.cli_node.v1_0_0.*`

    - [ ] **commands/fix_node_health.py** - Remove import of `omnibase.nodes.node_manager_node.v1_0_0.helpers.helpers_maintenance`
    - [ ] **Action Required:**
      - Implement dynamic node discovery via registry pattern
      - Remove all hardcoded node references from CLI infrastructure
      - CLI should only define interfaces and discovery mechanisms
    - **DoD:** CLI infrastructure has zero hardcoded node references
    - **Priority:** BLOCKING - affects all CLI functionality and user experience
    - **Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

- [ ] **Runtime Handler Architecture Violations (CRITICAL)**
    - [ ] **handlers/handler_metadata_yaml.py** - Remove import of `omnibase.nodes.stamper_node.v1_0_0.helpers.metadata_block_normalizer`
    - [ ] **handlers/handler_python.py** - Remove import of `omnibase.nodes.stamper_node.v1_0_0.helpers.metadata_block_normalizer`

- [ ] **Handler Misplacement (MAJOR)**
    - [ ] **handlers/handler_ignore.py** - Move to runtimes/onex_runtime/v1_0_0/handlers/ and refactor to use strongly typed models for all handler methods (no Any, tuple returns, or untyped context).
    - [ ] **Action Required:**
      - Move specific implementation to runtime directory
      - Update imports and registry references
      - handlers/ should contain only base classes, protocols, and mixins
    - **DoD:** handlers/ contains only shared abstractions
    - **Priority:** HIGH - affects handler architecture consistency
    - **Estimated Effort:** 0.5 days

- [ ] **handlers/block_placement_mixin.py** - Refactor to use strongly typed models for policy parameter and remove Any usage.

### 2. Phase 1: Enums and Core Result Models
- Implement missing Enums and Result Models before touching broader typing.
- This enables consistent replacement of `Dict[str, Any]` and magic literals in protocol and infrastructure layers.

  - **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

- [ ] **Create Missing Result Models**
  - [ ] **HandlerInfoModel** to replace `Dict[str, Any]` in registry
  - [ ] **ExtractBlockResult** for handler extract operations (replace tuple returns)
  - [ ] **SerializeBlockResult** for handler serialize operations (replace string returns)
  - [ ] **CapabilityResult** for can_handle operations (replace bool returns)
  - [ ] **HandlerMetadata** for typed metadata instead of `Dict[str, Any]`
  - **DoD:** All protocol methods return typed models instead of primitives
  - **Priority:** BLOCKING - required for protocol compliance
  - **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

### 4. Phase 3: Canary File Lock-In and Metadata Enforcement
- Nominate and validate Canary files for all supported extensions.
- Run Canary validation before any batch stamping.
- Re-stamp metadata only after type system and architecture are locked.

- [ ] **Outdated Metadata Format**
    - [ ] **metadata_constants.py** - Re-stamp with current stamper to fix missing protocol_version, owner, copyright fields
    - [ ] **Action Required:** Run stamper on file to update to current metadata format
    - **DoD:** All metadata follows current format standards
    - **Priority:** MEDIUM - affects metadata consistency
    - **Estimated Effort:** 0.5 days

- [ ] **Canary File Safeguard for Stamping Operations**
    - [ ] Select and nominate one real, protocol-compliant file for each handled extension (Markdown, Python, YAML) as Canary files.
    - [ ] Before any batch stamping run, run the stamper on all Canary files and immediately validate them using the parity validator node (protocol-first, --verbose or --format json).
    - [ ] If any Canary file fails validation, abort the batch operation and emit a protocol-compliant error with diagnostic output. Do not proceed to batch stamping.
    - [ ] Update Canary file set as new filetypes are added (automate via handler registry if possible).
    - [ ] Log and document all Canary check results for auditability and include rationale in developer documentation.
    - **Rationale:** Prevents catastrophic batch corruption by surfacing protocol/handler/serialization errors early, before they can affect the entire codebase. Ensures protocol compliance and safety for all supported filetypes.

    - **Example Unified Metadata (Language-Agnostic):**
      ```yaml
      # === OmniNode:Metadata ===
      # ... standard 21-line file metadata ...
      # tools:
      #   validate_schema:
      #     type: function
      #     language: python

- [ ] **Node audit. Make sure all nodes match. Several are missing contracts. That should fail the parity node test. we should consider .onextrees for all nodes which could also be emitted during introspection and use that to test node homogeniaty**
    - **DoD:** All nodes have required manifests and pass parity validation
    - **Artifact:** Complete node.onex.yaml manifests for all 7 nodes
    - **Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Added missing node.onex.yaml manifest for schema_generator_node. All 7 nodes now have required manifests. Parity validator shows 35 passed validations with SUCCESS status.
- [ ] **Naming convention audit for all files**
    - **DoD:** All files follow canonical naming conventions with proper prefixes
    - **Artifact:** Renamed files and updated imports
    - **Remaining Actions:**
      - Fix architecture violations first (affects imports and dependencies)
      - Address file size violations (may affect naming during splits)
      - Verify nodes/ directory contains only node-specific code
      - Update any remaining files with missing prefixes after refactoring
    - **Priority:** MEDIUM - address after architecture violations resolved
    - **Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

### 5. Phase 4: Test Suite Canonicalization (All Layers)
- Split test types: node-local, handler, integration.
- Remove all hardcoded domain values, replace with model-driven fixtures and registries.
- Ensure all serialization/parsing uses handler registry.
- Validate edge cases and malformed inputs with protocol logic.

- [ ] **Test Case Requirements and Expected Results in Fixtures**
    - [ ] All test case/fixture definitions must include not only scenario setup but also the expected result(s) or requirements for each case.
    - [ ] Test logic must be generic and data-driven: it must load the scenario, run the code under test, and compare the actual result to the expected result from the fixture.
    - [ ] No expected results or requirements may be hardcoded in test logic; all must be defined in the test case data.
    - [ ] CI should validate that all test cases have expected results defined.
    - **Rationale:** Centralizes requirements, improves traceability, enables easier auditing and extension of test coverage, and ensures all test logic is requirements-driven.

- [ ] **Handler/Fixture/Integration Test Separation and Coverage**
    - [ ] All test cases (node-local, handler, integration, fixture) must be generated or injected via protocol-driven registries or handler serialization methods.
    - [ ] Assertions must be model-based or handler-driven, never string-based for domain fields.
    - [ ] All test parameterization must use protocol-driven registries or fixtures.
    - [ ] All test files must be reviewed for: no hardcoded domain values, no string-based assertions for domain fields, no parallel or ad-hoc logic for metadata block construction or parsing, full round-trip and idempotency coverage using handler logic.
    - [ ] Refactor node-local tests to use only in-memory, protocol-driven, handler-rendered test cases (no file-based fixtures for canonical/positive cases)
    - [ ] Add/expand handler-level tests in `tests/handlers/` to cover: file-based fixture parsing, edge cases and malformed files, delimiter/comment handling and legacy file support
    - [ ] Add/expand integration tests in `tests/tools/` or `tests/fixtures/` to cover: CLI and disk-backed stamping flows, end-to-end stamping and validation with real files, negative/malformed file scenarios
    - [ ] Ensure all handler/fixture/integration tests are separated from node-local protocol tests
    - [ ] Document the separation and rationale in `docs/testing/node_testing_guidelines.md` and `docs/testing/fixtures_guidelines.md`
    - [ ] 80% test coverage minimum for all files
    - [ ] No hardcoded dependencies or singletons

### 6. Phase 5: CI and Enforcement Hardening
- Add CI checks for import violations, file size, metadata format, handler placement.
- Enforce strict mypy and canonical architecture boundaries.

- [ ] **Add/Update CI checks for naming and file size**
    - **DoD:** CI fails on non-canonical names or oversized files.
    - **Artifact:** CI config, linter rules.
    - **Enhanced Requirements Based on Standards Review:**
      - [ ] Add CI check to prevent imports from nodes/ in shared directories (core/, model/, handlers/, cli_tools/, runtimes/)
      - [ ] Add CI check to prevent hardcoded node references in CLI infrastructure
      - [ ] Add CI check to enforce 500-line file size limit with specific exceptions
      - [ ] Add CI check to validate metadata format compliance
      - [ ] Add CI check to prevent specific implementations in shared handlers/ directory
      - [ ] Add linter rules to flag architecture violations automatically
    - **Priority:** HIGH - prevents regression of architecture violations
    - **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days (implement after architecture fixes)

### 7. Phase 6: Release Infrastructure and Final M1 Tagging
- Create stable branch, automate version tagging, changelog, RC testing.
- Final pass with parity validator, linting, and README/doc updates.
- Tag `v1.0.0` and begin M2 planning.
