> **Status:** Draft  
> **Last Updated:** 2025-05-18  
> **Purpose:** Define a tiered model for ONEX nodes to clarify execution semantics, state handling, side effect classification, and planning implications. This document supports clearer node authoring, validation, and orchestration.

## Overview

ONEX nodes are the core building blocks of the system. Each node is defined via metadata (`.onex`), a declared interface (`state_contract`), and an optional internal state handler (`reducer`). To support composability, testability, and execution planning, ONEX nodes are categorized into three functional tiers:

---

## Tier 1: Pure Functional Nodes (Stateless)

**Definition:** Deterministic transformations that accept external state and return modified state. No side effects, no internal state.

* **Meta Type:** `tool` or `utility`
* **Reducer:** None
* **State:** Uses only `state_contract`
* **Execution:** One-shot, stateless, side-effect free

**Examples:**

* Math functions (e.g., `add`, `scale`, `clamp`)
* Format converters (e.g., `dict_to_yaml`)
* Content transformers (e.g., `normalize_text`, `strip_html_tags`)
* Embedding or summarization wrappers

**Output State Pattern:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "result": "..."
}
```

---

## Tier 2: Reducer Nodes (Encapsulated State Logic)

**Definition:** Deterministic nodes that include an internal state machine. They support progressive state transitions across invocations.

* **Meta Type:** Often `tool` or `agent`
* **Reducer:** Implements `ReducerProtocol`
* **State:** Internal (via reducer) + External (via `state_contract`)
* **Execution:** Deterministic but state-aware

**Use Cases:**

* Retry with backoff
* Branching logic within a tool
* Memory for session-local data
* Stateful validators or classifiers

**Metadata Example:**

```yaml
reducer: src/omnibase/reducers/retry_tracker.py
```

**ReducerProtocol (stub):**

```python
class ReducerProtocol:
    def initial_state(self) -> dict: ...
    def dispatch(self, state: dict, action: dict) -> dict: ...
```

---

## Tier 3: Impure or Middleware Nodes

**Definition:** Nodes that perform side effectsâ€”network calls, file writes, logging, database mutations. May include reducers.

* **Meta Type:** `agent`, `plugin`, `utility`
* **Reducer:** Optional
* **State:** Optional internal state + external context
* **Execution:** Impure (side effects allowed)

**Examples:**

* Remote API callers
* Loggers, file writers
* External service wrappers
* Streaming output handlers

**Identification:**

* Future metadata field: `impure: true`
* Must document affected systems in metadata extensions

---

## Composition & Orchestration

ONEX allows recursive and declarative orchestration:

* Dependencies are declared in metadata (`dependencies`, `base_class`, `protocols_supported`)
* Reducers govern internal decision making
* External orchestration tools (planners) can treat all nodes as functions:

  ```
  (input_state: dict) -> (output_state: dict)
  ```
* Impure nodes may require planning constraints (e.g., ordering, mutex)

---

## Implications for Validation and Execution

### Validation:

* Tier 1: Strict schema validation
* Tier 2: Schema + reducer test coverage
* Tier 3: Additional sandboxing and policy checks

### Trust and Audit:

* All nodes may define `trust_score_stub`
* Impure nodes must track provenance and impact metadata

### Planning:

* Execution planner can use tier to optimize chaining
* Impure/middleware nodes may be deferred, parallelized cautiously, or require gating
* Nodes with declared `execution_profile` and `model_profiles` enable the planner to make decisions based on speed, accuracy, and cost, supporting context-aware and resource-optimized dispatch.
* Composite nodes using `memoization_tier: deep` benefit from subgraph-level caching and reusable execution paths identified via `trace_hash` structures.
* Reducer nodes may declare snapshot strategies to reduce session replay overhead, improving planner efficiency in stateful graph rehydration scenarios.

---

## Future Considerations

* Add `tier` or `impure` hint to `.onex` schema
* Reducers may optionally expose `reducer_contract` for test validation
* Add orchestration metadata for step flows, priority, retry budget

## Summary Table

| Tier | Type                | State    | Side Effects | Reducer  | Meta Type(s)           |
| ---- | ------------------- | -------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------------------- |
| 1    | Pure function       | None     | No           | No       | tool, utility          |
| 2    | Stateful (reducer)  | Local    | No           | Yes      | tool, agent            |
| 3    | Middleware / Impure | Optional | Yes          | Optional | utility, agent, plugin |
