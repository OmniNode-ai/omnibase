## 06 ‚Äì Performance Memory and Cost-Aware Execution

### Context & Origin

This document captures how ONEX uses performance tracking and cost metadata to build a self-optimizing node ecosystem. It builds from the idea:

> "If we track success/failure rates and hash outputs, we can measure how good a node is‚Äîand whether it should evolve."

---

### Core Features

#### ‚úÖ Performance Metadata Block

Each node stores historical execution results:

```yaml
performance:
  total_runs: 152
  success_count: 147
  failure_count: 5
  avg_latency_ms: 108
  avg_cost_usd: 0.0021
  last_success: true
```

#### ‚úÖ Trace Hash

```yaml
trace_hash = hash(node_id + input + config + output)
```

* Used to fingerprint the transformation
* Enables reproducibility, variant diffing, and cache keying

---

### Node Evolution and Self-Optimization

#### üîÅ Failure Recovery + Variant Generation

* Nodes that fail repeatedly are marked for regeneration
* The system attempts to:

  * Create a new node variant
  * Ensure different `trace_hash`
  * Evaluate success over N trials
* If no better node is produced, the prior is considered locally optimal

#### üß¨ Tournament-Based Selection

* Multiple variants can be run on the same prompt/config
* Winner is judged via validators or trust score
* Losing variants can be demoted or purged

---

### Trust and Reputation Metrics

```yaml
trust:
  score: 0.94
  signer: omninode.registry
  verified: true
  last_reviewed: 2025-05-14
```

* Updated based on historical performance and coverage
* Trust score affects:

  * Whether a node is considered for dispatch
  * Whether it needs fallback validation

---

### Cost Optimization Layer

#### üß† Cost-Aware Planning

Nodes declare model cost and context usage:

```yaml
model_profiles:
  - model: gpt-4-turbo
    cost_per_1k_tokens: 0.01
    context_limit: 128k
    success_rate: 96%
```

#### üîÑ Cost-Based Execution Routing

* Planner selects node variant based on:

  * Cost constraints
  * Acceptable accuracy threshold
  * Run mode (e.g., `fast_draft`, `balanced`, `max_precision`)

#### üìâ Context Minimization

* System tracks smallest context windows that achieve desired results
* Trimmed prompts, inputs, or config yield cheaper executions

---

### Execution Profiles

```yaml
execution_profile:
  speed: 8
  accuracy: 7
  efficiency: 9
```

* Used by orchestrators to route tasks
* Dynamically updated from performance block

**Status:** Core specification for performance-driven evolution, benchmarking, and cost-optimized planning in ONEX. All nodes are expected to generate and update performance metadata over time.
