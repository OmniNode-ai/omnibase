# ONEX Node Architecture: Performance, Memory, and Cost-Aware Execution

> **Status:** Canonical  
> **Series:** Node Architecture  
> **Precedence:** This document is part of the Node Architecture Series and takes precedence over any conflicting documentation. 

## 06 ‚Äì Performance Memory and Cost-Aware Execution

### Context & Origin

This document captures how ONEX uses performance tracking and cost metadata to build a self-optimizing node ecosystem. This system monitors the execution characteristics of individual node "functions" and composed workflows to inform planning, select optimal implementations, and drive evolution. It builds from the idea:

> "If we track the performance and cost of each node **function call** and **function variant**, we can measure how 'good' a particular function implementation is‚Äîand whether it should evolve."

---

### Core Features

Key features enable the tracking and analysis of node function execution performance.

#### ‚úÖ Performance Metadata Block

Each node stores historical execution results, accumulating performance metrics for its function calls over time. This data informs trust, cost optimization, and evolution strategies.

```yaml
# Part of node.onex.yaml (or linked metadata)
performance:
  total_runs: 152      # Total number of times this function variant was called
  success_count: 147   # Number of successful function calls
  failure_count: 5     # Number of failed function calls
  avg_latency_ms: 108  # Average time taken for a function call to complete
  avg_cost_usd: 0.0021 # Average monetary cost per function call
  last_success: true   # Status of the most recent function call
```

#### ‚úÖ Trace Hash

The trace hash is a unique identifier fingerprinting a specific execution instance of a node function call.

```
trace_hash = hash(node_id + version + input_hash + config_hash + output_hash)
```

* **Function Call Fingerprint:** Used to uniquely identify a specific transformation performed by a node function with given inputs and configuration, producing a specific output.
* **Reproducibility:** Enables replaying or verifying the exact outcome of a past function call.
* **Variant Diffing:** Allows comparing the execution trace of different node function variants for the same task.
* **Cache Keying:** Forms a core component of the cache key, enabling memoization of function call results.

---

### Node Evolution and Self-Optimization

Performance and trust metadata drive a process of self-optimization and evolution for node function implementations.

#### üîÅ Failure Recovery + Variant Generation (Functional Improvement)

* When a node function call fails repeatedly, the system can flag the specific node variant (function implementation) for review or automatic regeneration.
* The system attempts to generate or select a new **node variant** (a different implementation intended to fulfill the same `state_contract`).
* The new variant is evaluated over a trial period (N trials) to measure its success rate and performance characteristics.
* If the new variant performs better (higher success, lower cost, lower latency), it can be promoted. If no better variant is produced, the prior may be considered locally optimal for the current context.

#### üß¨ Tournament-Based Selection (Choosing the Best Function Variant)

* For critical tasks or during evaluation periods, multiple **node function variants** (different implementations of the same conceptual function, sharing a `state_contract`) can be run concurrently or sequentially on the same inputs.
* The "winner" is judged based on validation results (correct output `state_contract`) or aggregated trust/performance scores.
* Winning variants are promoted for general dispatch, while losing variants can be demoted, archived, or purged.

---

### Trust and Reputation Metrics

Trust metrics quantify the reliability and quality of a specific **node function implementation** based on its historical performance and other factors.

```yaml
# Part of node.onex.yaml (or linked metadata)
trust:
  score: 0.94        # Aggregated reliability/quality score (0.0 to 1.0)
  signer: omninode.registry # Entity that signed/verified the trust metadata
  verified: true     # Cryptographic verification status
  last_reviewed: 2025-05-14 # Timestamp of the last trust review or update
```

* **Dynamic Updates:** Updated based on historical performance (success rate, failure count, latency) and potentially external reviews or security audits.
* **Influences Dispatch:** The trust score affects whether a particular node function variant is considered for dispatch, its priority in planning, and whether it requires fallback mechanisms or additional validation downstream.

---

### Cost Optimization Layer

The cost optimization layer uses declared and tracked cost metadata to select the most efficient **node function variants** and orchestrate workflows in a cost-aware manner.

#### üß† Cost-Aware Planning

Nodes that interact with paid resources (like external models) declare their cost profiles.

```yaml
# Part of node.onex.yaml (or linked metadata)
model_profiles: # Cost related to model interactions within this function
  - model: gpt-4-turbo
    cost_per_1k_tokens: 0.01
    context_limit: 128k
    success_rate: 96% # Success rate specifically when using this model
# Node may also declare general execution cost or resource usage estimates
```

#### üîÑ Cost-Based Execution Routing (Selecting Function Variants)

* The planner selects which **node function variant** (implementation) to call based on cost constraints, acceptable accuracy/trust thresholds, and the desired `run_mode` (e.g., `fast_draft` which might pick cheaper, less accurate functions; `balanced`; `max_precision` which might pick more expensive, highly trusted functions).

#### üìâ Context Minimization (Optimizing Function Inputs)

* The system can track and potentially optimize the input `state_contract` (function arguments) to minimize the resources required for the node function call (e.g., trimming prompts for language models to fit within context windows or reduce token cost).

### Execution Profiles

Execution profiles provide a high-level summary of a node function's expected performance characteristics, used by orchestrators to quickly categorize and route tasks.

```yaml
# Part of node.onex.yaml (derived from performance data and declarations)
execution_profile:
  speed: 8      # Relative speed (e.g., 1-10)
  accuracy: 7   # Relative accuracy or quality (e.g., 1-10)
  efficiency: 9 # Relative cost-efficiency (e.g., 1-10)
  # Other potential metrics: memory_usage, security_rating, etc.
```

* **Used by Orchestrators:** Orchestrators use these profiles to route tasks to appropriate execution rings or select function variants based on overall workflow goals.
* **Dynamic Updates:** Dynamically updated from the detailed performance metadata block and potentially model profiles.

Composite nodes using `memoization_tier: deep` should propagate subgraph-level execution profiles as well. This enables the planner to reason not only about the outer composite but also about the cost, speed, and accuracy of the internal function calls. When identical subgraphs are reused across workflows, their cached execution profiles can significantly improve dispatch speed and reduce cost by eliminating redundant function calls.

---

**Status:** This document is the core specification for performance-driven evolution, benchmarking, and cost-optimized planning in ONEX, framing these concepts in terms of measuring, comparing, selecting, and optimizing the execution of **executable node functions** and their variants. All nodes are expected to generate and update performance metadata over time.
