## üß≠ Future Work (Proposed Link Types)

Beyond the current M1 linking fields (`dependencies`, `base_class`, `protocols_supported`), future schema versions (M3+) may introduce richer link types to model node graphs, derivations, provenance, and compatibility.

| Proposed Field     | Purpose                                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `consumes`         | Declares what data types, state_contracts, or formats this node reads       |
| `produces`         | Declares what formats or data types this node emits                              |
| `compatible_with`  | Indicates safe chaining compatibility based on shared state_contracts       |
| `fork_of`          | Marks this node as a fork of another node (version, derivation, reuse)      |
| `generated_by`     | Points to the node or tool that scaffolded or generated this node            |

These fields are reserved and will be introduced in Milestone 3+ via schema version updates and enforcement logic. Nodes using these links will benefit from improved visualization and analysis in node graphs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Extensions (Planned - Reducer & Impurity)

The following enhancements are proposed for future versions of the ONEX Node Specification, primarily related to formalizing and enhancing impure and stateful node behaviors managed by reducers.

1.  **Reducer State Schema Definition (`reducer_contract`)**: Define a mechanism for reducers to declare the JSON Schema for their internal state.
    * *Rationale:* Aids testing (can validate reducer state transitions), introspection, and potential debugging tools.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M2+ (following initial `reducer` field introduction).

2.  **Reducer Chaining within a Node**: Support composing multiple reducers or state transition functions within a single node.
    * *Rationale:* Allows breaking down complex internal state logic into smaller, testable units.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M3+

3.  **Explicit Orchestration Chains between Reducer Nodes**: Define metadata or runtime patterns for orchestrating sequences of dispatches or interactions across multiple stateful/reducer nodes.
    * *Rationale:* Enables building stateful workflows spanning multiple nodes.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M3+

4.  **Impure Node Policy Enforcement**: Define validation rules and runtime policies specifically for impure nodes (e.g., requiring documentation of side effects, sandboxing considerations, resource usage tracking).
    * *Rationale:* Ensures impure nodes are used responsibly and securely.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M3+

## üèóÔ∏è Future Extensions (Planned - Trust & Validation)

These enhancements focus on improving the trust model, validation, and security features of ONEX nodes.

1.  **Cryptographic Signatures**: Full support for cryptographic signing and verification of node metadata, including trust attestations from trusted entities.
    * *Rationale:* Enables secure distribution and verification of nodes from trusted sources and provides tamper-evidence.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M2+

2.  **Runtime Trust Assessment**: Define runtime procedures for dynamically assessing and updating trust scores based on execution history, output validation outcomes, resource usage, and other measurable factors.
    * *Rationale:* Allows systems to learn which nodes are reliable and trustworthy based on actual usage patterns in diverse environments.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M3+

3.  **Graduated Trust Levels**: Formalize a graduated trust system (beyond simple binary verification) where nodes can earn higher trust levels through successful execution, validation, endorsement, and code audits.
    * *Rationale:* Provides a more nuanced approach to trust than binary trusted/untrusted, enabling more flexible planning and routing.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M3+

## üîÑ Future Extensions (Planned - Versioning & Evolution)

These enhancements address the evolution and versioning of nodes over time, ensuring compatibility and manageability in a growing ecosystem.

1.  **Version Compatibility Declarations**: Explicit metadata declarations specifying backward and forward compatibility between node versions and their state contracts/protocols.
    * *Rationale:* Simplifies dependency management, automated updates, and migration planning for workflows and dependent nodes.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M2+

2.  **Deprecation Mechanisms**: Formal process and metadata for marking nodes, specific node versions, or specific fields/protocols as deprecated.
    * *Rationale:* Ensures clear communication about lifecycle status, encourages migration to newer versions, and allows runtimes to handle deprecated nodes gracefully.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M2+

3.  **Breaking Changes Protocol**: Standardized way to document, communicate, and potentially detect breaking changes in node interfaces (`state_contract`, protocols) or behavior.
    * *Rationale:* Reduces friction during updates and version changes for node authors and workflow developers.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M2+

## üíæ Future Extensions (Planned - Caching & Performance)

These enhancements focus on improving the performance and efficiency of node execution and workflow orchestration.

1.  **Refinement and Full Implementation of Composite Node Memoization Tiering**: While the concept of `shallow` vs `deep` memoization tiering is defined, future work will focus on the full, robust implementation and optimization of recursive subgraph result caching.
    * *Rationale:* Improves performance for reusable composite nodes and unlocks advanced subgraph-level optimization across workflows.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M2+

2.  **Advanced Subgraph Trace Fingerprinting and Equivalence Matching**: Define and implement robust mechanisms to compute and match `trace_hash` trees across potentially different composite workflow structures for granular cache reuse and dynamic variant equivalence detection.
    * *Rationale:* Enables sharing of cached results between structurally or behaviorally equivalent function graphs, even if they aren't syntactically identical composite nodes.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M3+

3.  **Enhancements to Planner-Aware Execution Profiles and Cost/Trust/Speed Optimization Logic**: Build out sophisticated planning algorithms that leverage `execution_profile`, `model_profiles`, and `trust_score` metadata for advanced graph shaping, variant selection, and dispatch optimization based on user-defined goals (cost-efficiency, speed, max accuracy).
    * *Rationale:* Supports intelligent, goal-directed execution planning and selective function routing based on measured and declared performance characteristics.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M2+

4.  **Fine-grained Cacheability Controls**: Allow nodes to specify caching behaviors and invalidation rules at a granular level (e.g., exclude specific input fields from the cache key, define custom invalidation triggers).
    * *Rationale:* Enables more efficient and accurate caching strategies tailored to specific node behaviors, particularly for stateful or impure nodes.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M2+

5.  **Performance Profiling Integration**: Integrate built-in performance profiling, benchmarking, and reporting capabilities into the ONEX runtime and tools.
    * *Rationale:* Provides the necessary data for optimization efforts, comparison between node implementations, and updating performance metadata blocks.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M3+

6.  **Resource Usage Declarations and Tracking**: Allow nodes to declare expected resource usage (memory, CPU, network, etc.) and implement runtime tracking of actual resource consumption.
    * *Rationale:* Aids in resource planning, efficient node allocation to execution environments, and cost optimization.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M3+

7.  **Reducer Snapshotting Support**: Support in-session snapshotting and persistence of reducer-managed internal state to reduce replay overhead and improve restart efficiency for long-running or frequently interrupted stateful node sessions.
    * *Rationale:* Enhances fault tolerance and performance of stateful node executions.
    * *Suggested Milestone:* M3+
