### Future Optimizations (for Function Graph Orchestration)

* **Subgraph Memoization & Reuse:** Advanced caching techniques applied to frequently executed composite functions (subgraphs).
* **Cost-Aware Graph Shaping:** Planner considers the cost of node function calls when determining execution paths or variant selection.
* **Parallel Job Queue per Execution Ring:** Optimized dispatching of batched function calls to execution resources.
* **Agent-Driven Graph Mutation + Rerun:** Agents or stateful nodes (via reducers) can dynamically modify the planned function call graph based on intermediate results and request re-planning/re-execution of parts of the graph.
* **Cold Snapshot Replay:** Ability to reconstruct and replay past workflow executions directly from the cached history of function calls and their results.

---

**Status:** Canonical definition of the ONEX graph planner and execution resolver. It frames the process as orchestrating a graph of node functions based on their interfaces and metadata, forming the basis for the run loop, stream dispatchers, and future agent-integrated planning layers.

--- 
* **Trust-Aware Planner Pruning:** Exclude low-trust or deprecated node variants early in the planning phase based on trust score thresholds, recent failure rates, or soft-fail metadata.
* **Execution Mode Filtering:** Support planning modes (`fast_draft`, `balanced`, `max_precision`) to dynamically filter candidate nodes based on execution profiles (speed, cost, accuracy).
* **Subgraph Memoization & Reuse:** Apply deep memoization techniques for composite nodes by caching not only input/output but subgraph execution traces (`trace_hash`). Allow equivalence detection between structurally similar subgraphs.
* **Cost-Aware Graph Shaping:** Incorporate cost metadata and execution profiles to influence variant selection and overall graph topology, optimizing for cost-efficiency or performance.
* **Parallel Job Queue per Execution Ring:** Dispatch execution batches based on typology and resource isolation (e.g., run Tier 1 pure nodes concurrently, isolate Tier 3 impure nodes).
* **Agent-Driven Graph Mutation + Rerun:** Allow agents or reducers to modify execution graphs mid-flight in response to runtime data, inserting or replacing node calls adaptively.
* **Cold Snapshot Replay:** Use cached execution records to reconstruct and replay past workflows for debugging, benchmarking, or offline execution recovery.
* **Variant Scoring and Promotion:** Track the performance of multiple function implementations per state contract, promoting high-performing variants over time through trust-weighted selection.
