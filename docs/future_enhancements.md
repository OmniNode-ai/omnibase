# Future Enhancements: Debug Logging & Process

## 1. Automated Timestamps
- Develop CLI/script/editor integration to auto-insert ISO 8601 timestamps and engineer names for each debug entry.
- Consider pre-commit or post-commit hooks for enforcement.

## 2. Metadata Block in Logs
- Require a YAML or JSON metadata block at the top of each debug log for easy parsing, search, and automation.
- Fields: log_owner, week, repo_version, created_at, tags, etc.

## 3. Tag Major Issues
- Standardize a tagging system for debug entries (e.g., #blocker, #regression, #infra, #protocol).
- Enable filtering and summarization for both humans and bots.

## 4. Rotation/Archival
- At the end of each quarter or milestone, roll up weekly debug logs into an archive (e.g., debug_log_Q2_2025.md).
- Automate archival and compression as part of release or CI workflows.

## 5. Other Ideas
- Integrate debug log search/filter into CLI or web dashboard.
- Link debug log entries to velocity logs, PRs, and issues for full traceability.
- Add machine-readable status fields for automated reporting.

# Ephemeral Function Nodes and Live Node Discovery (ONEX Runtime Enhancement)

## Overview
This document defines the mechanism and architecture for enabling ONEX to support dynamic in-memory function wrapping, node discovery, and runtime graph composition. These enhancements build on the MVN model and expand the execution model to support agent-driven workflows and ephemeral pipelines.

---

### 1. Function-to-Node Compilation (f2n)
A runtime utility that transforms a single Python function into a fully compliant ONEX node.

**Responsibilities:**
- Parse function signature and body
- Generate input/output dataclasses
- Attach a metadata_block (UUID, hash, trust level, tags)
- Produce a .run() executable node object
- Register as ephemeral or persistent, based on context

**This allows agents or programs to:**
- Wrap raw functions in memory
- Execute without writing to disk
- Bind wrapped functions into executable graphs

---

### 2. In-Memory Execution Model
**Capabilities:**
- .run() executes in memory
- .bind() enables DAG composition
- Supports snapshotting, rollback, and replay
- No file I/O required for execution or registration

**Advantages:**
- Enables live prototyping and mutation
- Facilitates fast subgraph benchmarking and substitution
- Supports autonomous code generation and validation pipelines

---

### 3. Node Announcement Protocol
Each node, upon coming online (in memory or disk), emits a node_announce event.

**Payload Example:**
```json
{
  "node_id": "uuid-or-hash",
  "metadata_block": { ... },
  "status": "ephemeral" | "online" | "validated",
  "execution_mode": "memory" | "container" | "external",
  "inputs": { "type": "schema summary" },
  "outputs": { "type": "schema summary" },
  "graph_binding": "optional-subgraph-id"
}
```

**Transport:**
- JetStream (external)
- Redis Streams (internal)
- Optional: HTTP/gRPC fallback

---

### 4. Node Collector Service
A centralized runtime service responsible for managing live node discovery and registration.

**Responsibilities:**
- Listen for node_announce messages
- Maintain registry of active and ephemeral nodes
- Provide live lookup for agents and schedulers
- Track: trust state, TTL (ephemeral expiration), graph membership

**Optional:**
- Quarantine invalid or rejected nodes
- Validate subgraphs
- Score trust and stability over time

---

### 5. Agentic Applications
**Supported Use Cases:**
- Autonomous Code Generation (extract → wrap → test → emit → register)
- Subgraph Optimization (replace slow nodes with better variants on demand)
- Training/Evaluation in Memory (agents execute candidate functions in ephemeral graphs)
- Runtime Mutation and Experimentation (inject, remove, and rewire nodes live without disk writes)

---

### 6. Next Steps
- Implement f2n(fn: Callable) -> Node
- Define and emit node_announce messages
- Build CollectorNode for live registry
- Integrate into ORBIT and test with in-memory agents

---

### 7. Open Questions
- What determines persistence vs. ephemeral lifetime?
- How do we snapshot or cache node results efficiently?
- Can ephemeral node graphs be exported and rehydrated as stable workflows?

---

**Milestone 1 Note:**
- No immediate engineering work is required for Milestone 1, but the event schema and minimal f2n prototype could be started as a stretch goal or for early agentic experimentation.
- This specification is a prerequisite for Milestone 2 distributed runtime support and graph-level agent interaction.
