# Future Enhancements: Debug Logging & Process

## 1. Automated Timestamps
- Develop CLI/script/editor integration to auto-insert ISO 8601 timestamps and engineer names for each debug entry.
- Consider pre-commit or post-commit hooks for enforcement.

## 2. Metadata Block in Logs
- Require a YAML or JSON metadata block at the top of each debug log for easy parsing, search, and automation.
- Fields: log_owner, week, repo_version, created_at, tags, etc.

## 3. Tag Major Issues
- Standardize a tagging system for debug entries (e.g., #blocker, #regression, #infra, #protocol).
- Enable filtering and summarization for both humans and bots.

## 4. Rotation/Archival
- At the end of each quarter or milestone, roll up weekly debug logs into an archive (e.g., debug_log_Q2_2025.md).
- Automate archival and compression as part of release or CI workflows.

## 5. Other Ideas
- Integrate debug log search/filter into CLI or web dashboard.
- Link debug log entries to velocity logs, PRs, and issues for full traceability.
- Add machine-readable status fields for automated reporting.
