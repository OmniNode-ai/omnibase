### Key Achievements

#### Documentation & Architecture
- Added comprehensive "Future Enhancements" section to ONEX node specification with 10 detailed proposals (versioning, trust, health/status, tagging, linking, extensions, security, provenance, serialization, compatibility)
- Enhanced Milestone 0 bootstrap with process improvements and contributor guidance
- Created canonical templates for validators, CLI tools, registry components
- Completed ONEX node schema format with linking, validation rules, and discovery format

#### Testing Framework
- Established canonical testing philosophy in `docs/testing.md`
- Added in-memory validation approach with fixture swapping pattern
- Set up parametrized test patterns and test registry implementation

#### Protocol Definition
- Migrated core protocols from foundation to ONEX/OmniBase
- Added concrete registry implementation aligned with protocol interfaces
- Created schema loader stubs for YAML/JSON with graceful error handling

#### Migration Planning
- Created detailed migration plan for legacy code with staged batch approach
- Established `legacy/` staging directory with full foundation codebase
- Added migration tracking in `docs/migration_log.md`
- Implemented hybrid approach to minimize technical debt during transition
