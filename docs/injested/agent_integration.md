# OmniBase Agent Integration & Extension Toolkit

## Overview

OmniBase is designed to support agent-generated components from first principles. The Agent Integration Toolkit enables agents to dynamically generate, validate, and register tools, validators, and test cases in compliance with all OmniBase protocols.

---

## Agent Interaction Model

Agents interact with OmniBase through:

- Scaffolding templates
- Protocol definitions (`typing.Protocol`)
- Metadata block generators
- Runtime registration APIs
- Validation and simulation environments

---

## Core Workflow

1. **Prompt**: Agent receives a task (e.g. “build a validator to check missing headers”)
2. **Synthesize**: Agent generates code that conforms to the `run()` signature
3. **Stamp**: Agent adds a metadata block describing the component
4. **Validate**: Sandbox runner checks for protocol compliance
5. **Register**: Component is registered into the local registry
6. **Execute**: OmniBase dispatches the function like any other component

---

## Protocol Scaffolds

Provided for agent consumption:

- `Artifact[T]`
- `ExecutionContext`
- `Result[U]`
- `ValidationResult`, `TransformResult`, etc.

All include `__protocol_version__` and are type-checkable.

---

## Example Scaffold

```python
from omnibase.protocols import Artifact, ExecutionContext, ValidationResult

def run(input: Artifact[str], context: ExecutionContext) -> ValidationResult:
    if "TODO" in input.read_text():
        return ValidationResult.fail("Found TODO in source code.")
    return ValidationResult.pass_()
```

---

## Metadata Injection

Agents inject structured YAML either:

- As a top-level block in the file
- Or as a `.metadata.yaml` sidecar file

Validator example:

```yaml
# === OmniNode:Metadata ===
uuid: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
name: "check_todo_comments"
type: "validator"
version: "0.1.0"
entrypoint: "validators/check_todo.py"
lifecycle: "canary"
tags: ["agent", "generated"]
protocols_supported: ["O.N.E. Core v0.1"]
# === /OmniNode:Metadata ===
```

---

## Agent Tooling APIs

```python
class AgentToolkit:
    def validate_code(self, code: str) -> bool: ...
    def extract_metadata(self, code: str) -> dict: ...
    def register_component(self, code: str) -> UUID: ...
    def simulate_run(self, input_artifact: Artifact, component_code: str) -> Result: ...
```

Includes sandboxed execution, capability checks, and trace emission.

---

## Validation Runner

```bash
omnibase validate agent_output.py
```

Checks:

- Protocol compliance (`run` signature, type annotations)
- Metadata presence and format
- Security compliance (e.g. no disallowed imports)
- Runtime simulation with test artifact

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Feedback loop APIs for agents to learn from execution outcomes
- [ ] Trust scoring for agent-generated components
- [ ] Live coding environment for agent debugging
- [ ] Mutation testing for robustness of generated validators

> Agents don’t need permission to contribute—they need structure, scaffolds, and simulation sandboxes.
