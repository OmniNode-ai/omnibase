# OmniBase Monitoring and Observability Specification

> **Status:** Canonical
> **Last Updated:** 2025-05-16
> **Purpose:** This document defines canonical monitoring, alerting, analytics, and observability protocols for the OmniBase/ONEX platform. All agent, validator, and node monitoring requirements, alerting policies, and analytic tracking standards are specified here.

## 1. ONEX Monitoring Metrics and Alerting Protocols (v0.1)

OmniBase Monitoring Protocols

Overview

This document defines monitoring expectations, alerting policies, and analytic tracking for dynamically created agents within the OmniBase platform.

⸻

1. Metrics to Track

Agent-Level Metrics
	•	creation_success_rate
	•	validation_success_rate
	•	average_creation_time
	•	error_rates_by_stage

⸻

2. Alerts and Thresholds

Conditions

alerts:
  - condition: "creation_success_rate < 90%"
    action: "notify_team"
    channel: "agent.alerts"
  - condition: "error_rates_by_stage.validation > 10%"
    action: "pause_creation"
    duration: "1h"

⸻

3. Analytics Collection

Trend Tracking
	•	Popular Capabilities
	•	Resource Usage Patterns
	•	Common Failure Modes

Data Retention
	•	Retain analytics for: 90 days
	•	Use for optimization and predictive validation improvements

⸻

4. Logging Requirements
	•	All validation traces must be stored
	•	Correlate failures with source templates and dependency changes

⸻

5. Continuous Improvement
	•	Weekly metric rollups
	•	Automated dashboard updates
	•	Integration with trust scoring in Registry roadmap

- [ ] Registry and pipeline analytics
- [ ] Custom dashboard integration
- [ ] Predictive anomaly detection

> For all monitoring, alerting, and analytics requirements, this document is the canonical source of truth.

# Validated Monitoring & Metrics Framework (ONEX MVP Additions)

> **ONEX v0.1 Canonical Section**
> This section is canonical and additive to the existing monitoring protocols. It captures new development, system, and quality metrics validated for ONEX MVP and open source alignment.

---

## Categories

### 1. Development Metrics

- Code coverage per container
- Number of validator failures per commit
- Time from commit to green CI
- Metadata compliance rate

### 2. System Metrics

- Container boot time
- Message bus delivery latency (mean, p95)
- Validator registry sync time
- Validator queue size

### 3. Quality Metrics

- Number of CI failures per contributor per week
- Pre-commit hook bypass rate
- Number of skipped validations (by flag)
- Metadata diff failures per PR

---

These metrics are tracked in addition to the core agent-level and system-level metrics defined in the main monitoring protocols. They are required for ONEX MVP and public-facing CI/CD reporting.
