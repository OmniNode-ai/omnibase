# ONEX Event Schema Future Enhancements

> **Status:** Planning Document  
> **Last Updated:** 2025-05-25  
> **Purpose:** Document planned future enhancements for the ONEX event schema system

## Overview

This document outlines planned future enhancements for the ONEX Event Schema system. These enhancements were identified during the innovation phase of the Event Schema Standardization implementation and represent potential improvements for future development cycles.

## Current Implementation Status

### Implemented Features (v1.0.0)

- **Core Event Schema**: Standardized `OnexEvent` model with required fields
- **Event Types**: Node lifecycle and telemetry operation events
- **Metadata Standards**: Structured metadata schemas for each event type
- **Schema Validation**: Comprehensive validation with strict/non-strict modes
- **Telemetry Integration**: Event emission integrated into telemetry system
- **Documentation**: Complete specification and implementation guidelines

### Current Limitations

1. **No Event Versioning**: Schema changes require careful coordination
2. **Limited Error Classification**: Basic error handling without structured codes
3. **No Performance Profiling**: Limited performance analysis capabilities
4. **Basic Correlation**: Simple correlation IDs without hierarchical relationships
5. **No Event Sampling**: All events emitted regardless of volume
6. **No Event Replay**: Limited debugging capabilities for complex issues

## Proposed Enhancements

### Phase 1: Core Improvements (Target: v1.1.0)

#### 1. Event Schema Versioning

**Problem**: Schema evolution requires breaking changes and complex migration procedures.

**Solution**: Add schema versioning to enable backward-compatible evolution.

```python
class OnexEvent(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields
    schema_version: str = Field(default="1.1.0", description="Event schema version")
```

**Benefits**:
- Enables gradual schema migration
- Supports multiple schema versions simultaneously
- Provides compatibility checking

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Low

#### 2. Standardized Error Codes

**Problem**: Error handling lacks structured classification for automated processing.

**Solution**: Implement hierarchical error code system.

```python
class OnexErrorCode(str, Enum):
    STAMP_FILE_NOT_FOUND = "ONEX_STAMP_001"
    VALIDATE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH = "ONEX_VALIDATE_002"
    # ... more codes
```

**Benefits**:
- Enables automated error classification
- Improves alerting and monitoring
- Facilitates error pattern analysis

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Low

#### 3. Enhanced Correlation Tracking

**Problem**: Current correlation tracking is flat and doesn't support hierarchical relationships.

**Solution**: Add parent/child correlation relationships and distributed tracing integration.

```python
class OnexEvent(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields
    parent_correlation_id: Optional[str] = None
    trace_id: Optional[str] = None
```

**Benefits**:
- Enables cross-node operation tracing
- Supports distributed tracing standards
- Improves debugging capabilities

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Medium

### Phase 2: Performance & Scalability (Target: v1.2.0)

#### 4. Event Sampling Configuration

**Problem**: High-frequency events can overwhelm the event system in production.

**Solution**: Implement configurable sampling rates for different event types.

```python
class EventSampler:
    def __init__(self, sample_rates: Dict[OnexEventTypeEnum, float]):
        self.sample_rates = sample_rates
    
    def should_emit(self, event_type: OnexEventTypeEnum) -> bool:
        rate = self.sample_rates.get(event_type, 1.0)
        return random.random() < rate
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces event bus load in production
- Maintains observability while controlling volume
- Configurable per event type

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Medium

#### 5. Event Batching Support

**Problem**: Individual event emission can be inefficient for high-volume scenarios.

**Solution**: Implement event batching with configurable limits.

```python
class EventBatcher:
    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 100, max_age_ms: int = 1000):
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.max_age_ms = max_age_ms
    
    def add_event(self, event: OnexEvent):
        # Batch events and flush when limits reached
        pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Improved throughput and reduced network overhead
- Better resource utilization
- Configurable batching parameters

**Implementation Effort**: High
**Risk**: Medium

#### 6. Event Size Optimization

**Problem**: Large events can impact performance and storage.

**Solution**: Implement compression and size limits for large events.

**Benefits**:
- Better performance and resource utilization
- Automatic compression for large events
- Size validation and warnings

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Low

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Target: v1.3.0)

#### 7. Event Replay Capability

**Problem**: Debugging complex issues requires the ability to replay event sequences.

**Solution**: Implement event storage and replay functionality.

```python
class EventReplaySystem:
    def record_event(self, event: OnexEvent):
        # Store event for replay
        pass
    
    def replay_events(self, correlation_id: str, speed_multiplier: float = 1.0):
        # Replay events for debugging
        pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Time-travel debugging capabilities
- Issue reproduction and analysis
- Testing and validation support

**Implementation Effort**: High
**Risk**: Medium

#### 8. Performance Profiling Events

**Problem**: Limited performance analysis capabilities within the event system.

**Solution**: Add specialized events for performance profiling.

```python
class PerformanceProfileEvent(OnexEvent):
    event_type: Literal[OnexEventTypeEnum.PERFORMANCE_PROFILE]
    metadata: PerformanceProfileMetadata
```

**Benefits**:
- Detailed performance insights
- No dependency on external profiling tools
- Integrated performance monitoring

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Low

#### 9. Event-Driven Alerting

**Problem**: Manual monitoring and alerting configuration is error-prone.

**Solution**: Implement real-time alerting based on event patterns.

```python
class EventAlertingEngine:
    def add_alert_rule(self, pattern: str, action: Callable):
        # Define alerting rules based on event patterns
        pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Proactive issue detection
- Automated response capabilities
- Configurable alerting rules

**Implementation Effort**: High
**Risk**: Medium

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration (Target: v2.0.0)

#### 10. OpenTelemetry Integration

**Problem**: Limited interoperability with standard observability tools.

**Solution**: Native integration with OpenTelemetry standards.

**Benefits**:
- Interoperability with standard observability tools
- Industry-standard tracing and metrics
- Broader ecosystem compatibility

**Implementation Effort**: High
**Risk**: Medium

#### 11. Schema Registry

**Problem**: No centralized schema management and discovery.

**Solution**: Implement a central registry for event schema discovery and validation.

**Benefits**:
- Schema validation and documentation
- Compatibility checking
- Centralized schema management

**Implementation Effort**: High
**Risk**: High

#### 12. Event Security & Encryption

**Problem**: Sensitive events lack encryption and integrity verification.

**Solution**: Implement encryption and signing for sensitive events.

**Benefits**:
- Secure event transmission
- Integrity verification
- Compliance with security requirements

**Implementation Effort**: High
**Risk**: High
