# Templates for ONEX/OmniBase Development

This directory contains canonical templates for validators, registries, CLI tools, and other core components. All new development should use or derive from these templates to ensure consistency and compliance with project standards.

Templates must be kept up to date as standards evolve. See docs/standards.md for naming and structure requirements.
