## 1 .  Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant v2](https://contributor-covenant.org).  Be respectful, assume good intent, and help each other succeed.

---

## 2 .  Project Philosophy

* **Protocol-first.**  Everything new should extend existing protocols or add new ones consciously.
* **Typed & tested.**  All production code **must** include type annotations & tests.
* **Fail fast.**  CI runs the same validation pipeline we ship â€“ passes locally â‡’ passes in CI.
* **Small, reviewable PRs.**  Aim for < 400 LOC per PR; split larger efforts.
* **Docs matter.**  Public APIs and design changes require doc updates in the same PR.

---

## 3 .  Branching & Versioning

```text
main        # always releasable
â”‚
â”œâ”€â–¶ feat/<slug>   # contributor branches
â”‚
â”œâ”€â–¶ release/x.y   # cut by maintainers when preparing tags
````

* Feature branches start from **main**.
* Use kebab-case slugs: `feat/async-registry`.
* Maintainers merge via **squash** to keep history linear.

---

## 4 .  Commit Messages

We follow **Conventional Commits** (<type>: <subject>) with present-tense verbs:

```text
feat: add pre-commit orchestrator skeleton
fix: correct semver warning logic
chore(ci): bump mypy to 1.10
```

Types: **feat**, **fix**, **docs**, **test**, **refactor**, **perf**, **chore**, **ci**.

---

## 5 .  Dev Environment

```bash
# Clone & install
$ git clone https://github.com/omninode/omnibase.git
$ cd omnibase
$ pipx install poetry  # or pip install --user poetry
$ poetry install --all-extras

# Set up pre-commit hooks
$ poetry run pre-commit install
```

`make validate` runs **Black**, **Flake8-OmniBase**, **MyPy**, **PyTest**, and **coverage**.

---

## 6 .  Testing Guidelines

* Place unit tests under `tests/unit/` mirroring the source path.
* Integration tests under `tests/integration/` â€“ may hit file system, SQLite, etc.
* Use `pytest-asyncio` for async functions.
* Target â‰¥ 95 % coverage for new modules.

---

## 7 .  Documentation Updates

* Update `docs/index.md` navigation if you add a top-level doc.
* For spec changes, bump the **version header** inside the spec file.
* Include runnable examples or snippets when possible.

---

## 8 .  Issue Labels

| Label              | Meaning                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `triage`           | Needs maintainer review & classification |
| `good first issue` | Low-complexity, mentorship available     |
| `help wanted`      | Core team busy â€“ PRs welcome             |
| `blocked`          | Waiting on external dependency           |
| `breaking`         | Requires major version bump              |

---

## 9 .  Pull Request Review Process

1. **CI must pass** before human review.
2. At least **one maintainer approval** required.
3. Requested changes should be addressed within 14 days; otherwise the PR may be closed or converted to a draft.
4. Maintainers add the `autosquash` label to merge.
5. GitHub Actions auto-delete the source branch after merge.
