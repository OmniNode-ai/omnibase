# Debug Log â€“ 2025-06-02 (Monday)

## Summary
- Reviewed and integrated new design documents for proxy invocation API and ZMQ event bus recommendations
- Extracted actionable engineering tasks from both documents
- Consolidated and updated the implementation checklist (docs/milestones/implementation_checklist_registry_node_port_allocation.md)
    - Clearly separated Milestone 1 (Immediate) and Milestone 2+ (Future/Stubbed) tasks
    - Added all protocol, CLI, registry, and event bus requirements from design docs
- Confirmed adoption of portpicker as the canonical solution for dynamic port management
- Ensured documentation and standards alignment for registry node, event bus, and proxy invocation

## Key Actions
- Full review of docs/onex/registry_node_proxy_invocation.md and docs/onex/zmq_event_bus_recommendations.md
- Extraction of all actionable and stubbed tasks
- Checklist update to reflect new requirements and design alignment
- Documentation of portpicker integration and registry node tracking requirements

## Blockers / Next Steps
- Begin implementation of Milestone 1 tasks in the checklist
- Review and prioritize Milestone 2+ tasks for future planning
- Continue standards enforcement and documentation updates as new features are implemented
- Monitor for any additional requirements or design changes as implementation progresses
