### Engineer: omnibase-ai (pairing with user)

#### Context
Refactoring and debugging the in-memory stamper protocol tests (`tests/utils/test_in_memory_stamper.py`) to ensure handler-based stamping, protocol compliance, and robust error/warning handling. The test suite is designed to be protocol-first and registry-driven, simulating all file I/O in memory.

#### Problem Statement
After refactoring to use handler-based stamping and protocol-driven error handling, several tests failed due to:
- Dummy handlers returning `None`, causing AttributeErrors.
- Test assertions expecting legacy error/warning messages or metadata fields not present in the dummy handler's output.
- Protocol now returns "No handler registered for file type" for unsupported types, but tests expected "Unsupported file type".
- Empty file tests expected a `"trace_hash"` in metadata, but dummy handlers returned empty metadata.

#### Hypotheses
- The dummy handler must always return a valid `OnexResultModel` with protocol-compliant status, messages, and (if needed) metadata.
- The test assertions must be robust to protocol-driven error/warning messages, not just legacy strings.
- For missing files, the engine should ideally return an error before calling the handler, but the current protocol may call the handler regardless.
- For empty files, the dummy handler should simulate a `"trace_hash"` in metadata if the test expects it.

#### Investigation Steps
1. Traced the import and registration of `FileTypeHandlerRegistry` to the correct module and usage pattern.
2. Updated dummy handlers to return a valid `OnexResultModel` with a warning and "Semantic validation failed" message.
3. Updated test assertions to accept protocol-driven error/warning messages and statuses.
4. Ran the test suite and observed that most tests now pass, but three still fail:
   - `test_stamp_missing_file`: Handler returns a generic warning, not a "does not exist" error.
   - `test_stamp_empty_file[yaml/json]`: Handler returns empty metadata, but test expects `"trace_hash"`.

#### Findings
- The protocol expects all handlers, including those for missing or empty files, to return a valid `OnexResultModel` with appropriate status, messages, and metadata.
- The current dummy handler implementation does not fully simulate the expected metadata or error messages for specific edge cases like missing or empty files.
- This standard—returning a valid `OnexResultModel`—should be consistently reflected in both the handlers and the test assertions to ensure protocol compliance.
- The engine may need updates to avoid calling handlers for missing files, or tests should be adapted to accept generic warnings returned by handlers in these cases.
- For empty files, the dummy handler should include a `"trace_hash"` in metadata to match test expectations.

#### Next Steps
- Update the dummy handler to optionally include a `"trace_hash"` key in its returned metadata when processing empty file tests to meet test expectations.
- Modify the `test_stamp_missing_file` test to accept a generic warning message from the handler if it is called, or alternatively, update the engine or test fixtures to prevent the handler from being called for missing files.
- Review and adjust all test assertions to align with protocol-driven error and warning messages, ensuring they do not rely on legacy strings.
- Re-run the full test suite after making these changes to confirm that all tests pass successfully.
- Document these protocol-driven expectations and test requirements clearly within the test file to assist future maintainers.

#### Notes for Future Maintainers
- All file type handlers must return a valid `OnexResultModel` object, even when handling missing or empty files.
- For missing files, handlers should provide appropriate warning or error messages within the `OnexResultModel`; however, ideally, the engine should prevent handler invocation in these cases.
- For empty files, handlers are expected to include specific metadata such as `"trace_hash"` to satisfy protocol and test requirements.
- Test assertions should be designed to handle protocol-driven messages and statuses rather than legacy or hardcoded strings, ensuring flexibility and robustness in the testing framework.
