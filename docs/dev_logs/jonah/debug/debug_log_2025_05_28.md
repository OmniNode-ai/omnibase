## Debug Entries

### Debug Entry: Stamper Idempotency Hash Computation Bug
- **Timestamp:** 2025-05-28T18:52:00Z
- **Engineer:** Claude Assistant
- **Tags:** #blocker, #regression, #stamper, #idempotency, #hash-computation
- **Context:**
  - User reported stamper using dictionaries instead of Pydantic models for hash computation
  - Python idempotency tests failing with hash mismatches on repeated stamping
  - Investigation into why `compute_metadata_hash()` function design is problematic

#### 1. Problem Statement
- Stamper idempotency tests failing for Python files
- Hash values changing between identical stampings when they should remain constant
- Root cause: `compute_metadata_hash()` function converts Pydantic models to dictionaries, reconstructs them, causing subtle differences
- Error pattern: `[IDEMPOTENCY] stored_hash=6ca81ce08188cec6..., computed_hash=d24e799d62301e3f..., content_changed=True`

#### 2. Initial Hypotheses
- **H1:** Dictionary reconstruction introduces field ordering differences
- **H2:** Enum serialization differs between original and reconstructed models  
- **H3:** Timestamp precision changes during reconstruction
- **H4:** Entrypoint object vs dict representation differences
- **H5:** Serializer function itself is non-deterministic

#### 3. Investigation Steps
1. **Analyzed hash computation flow:**
   ```python
   # Problematic flow in stamp_with_idempotency()
   existing_block_dict = prev_meta.model_dump()  # Pydantic → dict
   computed_hash = compute_metadata_hash(
       metadata=existing_block_dict,  # Pass dict
       # ...
   )
   # In compute_metadata_hash()
   model = NodeMetadataBlock.create_with_defaults(...)  # dict → new Pydantic model
   ```

2. **Created `compute_idempotency_hash()` function:**
   - Works directly with existing Pydantic model
   - Uses `model_copy(deep=True)` to avoid reconstruction
   - Masks volatile fields in-place with `setattr()`

3. **Removed old invalid functions:**
   - Deleted `canonicalize_for_hash()` and `compute_metadata_hash()`
   - Kept only `compute_idempotency_hash()` for existing blocks
   - Added `compute_metadata_hash_for_new_blocks()` for new block creation

4. **Updated mixin imports and function calls:**
   - Fixed import statements in `mixin_metadata_block.py`
   - Updated parameter names to match new function signatures
   - Fixed test file imports

#### 4. Observations
- **Issue persists after fixes:** Hash still changing between stampings
- **Debug output shows:** `stored_hash=6ca81ce08188cec6..., computed_hash=d24e799d62301e3f...`
- **YAML dump is deterministic:** Tested `yaml.dump()` - produces identical output
- **Reconstruction eliminated:** New function avoids dict→model conversion entirely
- **Serializer suspect:** Issue likely in `metadata_serializer` function producing different output

#### 5. Next Steps
1. **Debug serializer determinism:**
   - Test if `handler.serialize_block(same_model)` produces identical output twice
   - Investigate `serialize_metadata_block()` function for non-deterministic behavior
   
2. **Investigate serialization differences:**
   - Check if tools field YAML serialization is deterministic
   - Look for timestamp formatting differences
   - Examine enum serialization consistency

3. **Consider alternative approach:**
   - Compare actual serialized content that would be written to file
   - Use direct string comparison instead of hash comparison for idempotency
   - Implement content-based idempotency checking

4. **Root cause analysis:**
   - The fundamental issue may be that we're trying to compute hashes from serialized representations
   - Consider whether idempotency should be based on content equality rather than hash equality

5. **Validate serializer determinism under identical conditions:**
   - Freeze environment variables, timezone, and locale settings during test
   - Run `serialize_metadata_block(model_copy)` twice and diff the outputs
   - Confirm no entropy (e.g. UUIDs, timestamps) leaks into serialization path

6. **Draft fallback content-based equality mechanism:**
   - Write function `is_idempotent_via_content(model1, model2)` that uses normalized YAML string comparison
   - Run in test suite alongside hash-based check to evaluate consistency
   - If consistently more reliable, propose migration plan

### Debug Entry: Dictionary vs Pydantic Model Architecture Analysis
- **Timestamp:** 2025-05-28T18:30:00Z  
- **Engineer:** Claude Assistant
- **Tags:** #architecture, #design-flaw, #hash-computation
- **Context:**
  - User questioned why code uses dictionaries instead of Pydantic models
  - Analysis of hash computation system design and evolution

#### 1. Problem Statement
- Hash computation system has fundamental design mismatch
- `compute_metadata_hash()` designed for dictionaries (file parsing era)
- Now being called with Pydantic models that are unnecessarily converted to dicts

#### 2. Initial Hypotheses
- **H1:** Legacy design from when metadata was parsed from files as dicts
- **H2:** Reconstruction process is inherently lossy
- **H3:** Multiple hash functions exist for different use cases but are conflated

#### 3. Investigation Steps
1. **Traced hash computation evolution:**
   - Original design: Parse file → dict → compute hash
   - Current usage: Pydantic model → dict → reconstruct model → compute hash
   - Identified unnecessary round-trip conversion

2. **Analyzed reconstruction issues:**
   - Entrypoint: Object → dict → different object representation
   - Enums: Enum instances → strings → potentially different enum instances  
   - Defaults: `create_with_defaults()` may apply different defaults
   - Validation: Pydantic validation may normalize values differently

3. **Designed solution:**
   - `compute_idempotency_hash()`: Direct Pydantic model usage
   - `compute_metadata_hash_for_new_blocks()`: Dictionary-based for new blocks only
   - Eliminated problematic reconstruction step

#### 4. Observations
- **Design flaw confirmed:** Dictionary conversion is unnecessary for existing models
- **Multiple use cases:** New blocks (from dicts) vs existing blocks (from models) need different approaches
- **Reconstruction is lossy:** Even with same data, reconstructed models differ subtly

#### 5. Next Steps
- Continue debugging serializer determinism issue
- Consider whether hash-based idempotency is the right approach
- May need to move to content-based idempotency checking
- Implement test cases to validate that `compute_metadata_hash_for_new_blocks()` and `compute_idempotency_hash()` produce matching results when derived from the same source model
- Document assumptions in serializer logic, especially around enum handling and timestamp normalization

### Debug Entry: Canonical Serializer Solution and Batch Execution Plan
- **Timestamp:** 2025-05-28T19:00:00Z
- **Engineer:** Claude Assistant
- **Tags:** #solution, #canonical-serializer, #idempotency, #batch-execution
- **Context:**
  - Root cause analysis confirms non-deterministic serialization as the source of idempotency failures
  - All model/dict reconstruction and mutation issues have been eliminated
  - The only remaining source of entropy is the flattening and YAML serialization logic, especially for nested fields like `tools`

#### 1. Problem Statement
- Idempotency tests fail because the computed hash changes between otherwise identical stampings
- The serialization logic is not fully deterministic, causing byte-level differences in output

#### 2. Solution Proposal
- Implement a canonical, deterministic serializer for the metadata block:
  - Sort all keys (including nested dicts like `tools`)
  - Use block YAML style, normalized line endings, explicit start/end
  - Mask volatile fields with protocol placeholders
  - Serialize enums as their `.value`
  - Normalize all string/list fields to empty if null/None
- Use this serializer for both hash computation and file output
- Replace all handler-local serializers with the canonical serializer
- Add tests to ensure serializing the same model twice produces identical output

#### 3. Batch Execution Plan
1. Implement canonical serializer and update all usages
2. Add determinism tests
3. Run the full idempotency regression suite
4. Fix any failures
5. Repeat until all tests pass

#### 4. Next Steps
- Begin batch execution: implement, test, and iterate until all idempotency and serialization tests pass

### Debug Entry: Persistent Idempotency Failure – Canonicalization Discrepancy
- **Timestamp:** 2025-05-28T19:14:00Z
- **Engineer:** Claude Assistant
- **Tags:** #idempotency, #canonicalization, #debug, #regression
- **Context:**
  - Despite enforcing canonical field order, masking volatile fields, and using the canonical serializer, the idempotency regression tests for Python handler files still fail.
  - The only differences between stampings are the `hash` and `last_modified_at` fields, but the canonicalized previous and new blocks (with volatile fields masked) are still not identical between stampings, even though the content is unchanged.
  - The debug logs confirm that the canonicalized outputs are not byte-for-byte equal, which is the direct cause of the idempotency failure.

#### 1. Problem Statement
- Idempotency bug persists: repeated stamping of unchanged content produces different hashes and last_modified_at values.
- Canonicalization logic is not producing identical output for unchanged content.

#### 2. Evidence
- Diff output shows only `hash` and `last_modified_at` differ, but canonicalized blocks (with these masked) are still not equal.
- Debug logs print the canonicalized previous and new blocks, confirming the discrepancy.

#### 3. Hypothesis
- The canonical serializer or model dump logic is introducing subtle differences (e.g., default values, ordering, type normalization, or serialization quirks).
- There may be a mutation or non-determinism in the model or serializer.

#### 4. Next Steps
- Print and compare the full canonicalized outputs for both previous and new blocks.
- Identify the exact field(s) or formatting causing the difference.
- Patch the canonical serializer or model logic to ensure true byte-for-byte equality for unchanged content.

#### 5. Diff Output Example
```diff
-# hash: bcf4faf13edaf25ddc06b29c01a0ce5d86d69f7f348135114d6bc68d0caceb3e
+# hash: ebc17d05a9d8a5ec73d42d7c5a95148aebd92364d914fbfe1306b5b01943ac1e
 # inputs: null
-# last_modified_at: '2025-05-28T19:13:45.222924+00:00'
+# last_modified_at: '2025-05-28T19:13:45.254812+00:00'
```

- **Status:** Blocked on root cause of canonicalization discrepancy. Next: print and analyze full canonicalized outputs.
