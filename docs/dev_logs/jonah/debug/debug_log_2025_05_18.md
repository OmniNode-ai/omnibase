# Debug Log Entry

summary: |
  Investigation and attempted resolution of persistent mypy errors in two utility modules. The main blocker is a 'Returning Any from function declared to return "str"' error in extract_node_metadata_from_file, despite returning a string literal and using cast(str, ""). Also fixed pathspec import/assignment to resolve a Module/None assignment error. All other mypy errors are resolved.
```

## Details

### Issues Investigated
- **Persistent mypy error:**
  - `src/omnibase/utils/utils_node_metadata_extractor.py:237: error: Returning Any from function declared to return "str"  [no-any-return]`
  - Function implementation is a dummy: `return cast(str, "")`.
  - All attempts to silence mypy (literal, cast, type annotation) failed.
  - Hypothesis: mypy is confused by test monkeypatching, stubs, or cache.
- **pathspec assignment error:**
  - Fixed by using importlib and ModuleType for conditional import, avoiding double assignment and type errors.
  - Confirmed that should_ignore now always returns bool.

### Actions Taken
- Refactored pathspec import to use importlib and Optional[ModuleType].
- Explicitly cast dummy return value in extract_node_metadata_from_file to str.
- Cleared all other mypy errors in the two files.
- Ran mypy with --no-incremental to ensure cache was not the issue.

### Outstanding Issue
- The 'Returning Any from function declared to return "str"' error persists, even with all canonical fixes applied.
- Next steps: investigate for monkeypatching, stubs, or mypy config issues; try isolating the function in a new file.

### Additional Investigation (Suggested)

- Searched for monkeypatching of `extract_node_metadata_from_file` via pytest or test fixtures: No monkeypatching or test patching found in the codebase.
- Checked for existence of `.pyi` stubs for the module and for consistency of type annotations: No .pyi stubs found; all type annotations are consistent.
- mypy configuration (`pyproject.toml`):
    - mypy = "^1.15.0"
    - [tool.mypy] plugins = ["pydantic.mypy"]
    - mypy_path = "src"
- Python version: 3.11.11 (via poetry); mypy version: 1.15.0
- Isolated function in a new file; error did not persist: Minimal repro with only the function and cast passes mypy with no errors.
- Next steps:  
  - Confirm no monkeypatching or test patching present.  
  - Reconfirm all type stubs/annotations are consistent.  
  - Try `--strict` and minimal repro.  
  - File upstream if bug persists.

Conclusion: The error does not persist in isolation, suggesting a project-specific or environmental issue (e.g., plugin, cache, or mypy interaction with Pydantic or project structure).

# Assistant Additional Suggestions (2025-05-19)

- **Check for Indirect Import or Re-Export:**  
  - Search for any places in the codebase where `extract_node_metadata_from_file` is re-imported or re-exported through another module (e.g., `from ... import ... as ...`), especially with inconsistent type annotations, which can confuse mypy's inference.

- **Check for Conditional or Dynamic Import Patterns:**  
  - If this function is conditionally defined or imported anywhere (inside an `if` block, try/except, or by exec/eval), mypy can lose type context. Confirm function is defined and imported only at module scope.

- **Verify Pydantic Plugin Interactions:**  
  - The `[tool.mypy] plugins = ["pydantic.mypy"]` entry could cause inference side-effects. Temporarily comment out the Pydantic plugin in `pyproject.toml` and rerun mypy to determine if the error is plugin-related.

- **Confirm mypy Path and Discovery:**  
  - The setting `mypy_path = "src"` can sometimes lead mypy to pick up stale or shadowed modules. Ensure there are no duplicate or shadowed modules, especially `src/omnibase/utils/utils_node_metadata_extractor.py` elsewhere in `PYTHONPATH` or hidden build artifacts.

- **Try mypy with --show-traceback:**  
  - Run mypy with `--show-traceback` for additional diagnostic context on why the return type is being treated as `Any`.

- **Explicitly Type the Return in the Dummy Implementation:**  
  - Instead of `cast(str, "")`, try a trivial implementation that mypy cannot infer as Any, such as:  
    ```python
    def extract_node_metadata_from_file(...) -> str:
        out: str = ""
        return out
    ```
  - If this passes, the issue may be with cast usage in this context, possibly due to plugin interference.

- **File Upstream or Seek Project-Specific Help:**  
  - If all above steps fail, file a minimal reproducible bug with the mypy project, including your project structure and config, or raise a targeted issue in Pydantic/mypy forums.

---

These steps should help isolate persistent static analysis issues stemming from import patterns, plugin side effects, or mypy path confusion—each a known source of spurious `Any` returns.

#### Debug Entry: ONEX Stamping Engine Idempotency & Hash Stability
- **Timestamp:** 2025-05-18T21:45:00Z
- **Engineer:** jonah
- **Tags:** [#blocker, #idempotency, #hash, #yaml]
- **Context:**
  - Investigating persistent test failures in ONEX stamping engine: idempotency, hash stability, and YAML block extraction/normalization.
  - Goal: Create a durable, reviewable trace of all debugging steps, hypotheses, test results, and solutions for future reference.

---

##### 1. Problem Statement
- **Tests Failing:**
  - Idempotency: Stamping a file twice changes the hash or produces a malformed block.
  - Hash Stability: Hash changes on every stamp, even if only `last_modified_at` and `hash` fields differ.
  - YAML Handler: After stamping, block extraction or YAML parsing fails with `Normalized data is not a dict`.

##### 2. Initial Hypotheses
- Normalization of block placement and file structure is not enforced before hash computation and stamping.
- The hash computation may not use protocol placeholders for `hash` and `last_modified_at`.
- Subtle differences in block extraction, comment prefix stripping, or re-serialization may cause YAML parsing to fail after repeated stamps.

##### 3. Investigation Steps
- Added granular debug logs to:
  - Block extraction and comment prefix stripping (before YAML load)
  - Canonical string used for hash computation (before hashing)
- Ran the full test suite to capture logs and compare canonical content between stamps.
- Manually compared canonical string and block YAML between first and second stamp for hidden drift (whitespace, field order, encoding, or serialization differences).
- Observed that the only differences are in the expected volatile fields, but the hash still changes and YAML parsing fails after repeated stamps.
- Hypothesized that YAML serialization (via PyYAML) is not fully deterministic—field order, quoting, or null representation may change between stamps.
- Planned to enforce deterministic serialization by sorting keys, using explicit null representation, and consistent quoting in the serialization utility.

##### 4. Observations
- **Block Extraction:**
  - The block is present and appears correct in debug logs after each stamp.
  - The comment prefix stripping produces a valid YAML string.
- **Hash Computation:**
  - The canonical string used for hash computation is stable except for `last_modified_at` and `hash` fields, as expected.
  - However, the hash still changes on every stamp, indicating a subtle drift or non-idempotent field.
- **YAML Parsing:**
  - After the second stamp, YAML parsing fails with `Normalized data is not a dict`, even though the block appears correct in logs.
- **Test Failures:**
  - Idempotency and hash stability tests still fail.
  - The only differences in canonical string are the expected volatile fields, but the hash is not stable.
  - Suspect non-deterministic YAML serialization as the root cause.

##### 5. Next Steps
- Update the YAML serialization utility to always use sorted keys, explicit null representation, and consistent quoting.
- Re-run the tests and compare the canonical string and block YAML between stamps.
- If the hash becomes stable and YAML parsing succeeds, this confirms the hypothesis. If not, continue investigating for other sources of non-idempotency or parsing drift.

---

#### Assistant Analysis & Suggestions

- **Hash Stability and Idempotency**
  - Enforce deterministic YAML serialization: always use sorted keys, explicit null representation, and consistent quoting.
  - Before hash computation, normalize all volatile fields (such as `hash` and `last_modified_at`) to placeholders or remove them from the hash input.
  - Implement a canonicalization utility that takes the metadata block, strips or replaces volatile fields, and serializes using deterministic options. Round-trip test this process: serialize, parse, serialize again, and confirm identical output.
  - Ensure comment prefix stripping in YAML block extraction is lossless with respect to whitespace, quoting, and line endings.
  - Add minimal tests that stamp, serialize, and compare output for drift across multiple cycles.

- **Test Utility Interface**
  - Refactor all test stubs (e.g., `DummyMetaBlock`) to inherit from the canonical metadata model or implement the required `model_dump` method to match the Pydantic v2 interface.
  - Add type and protocol compliance checks for all test utilities in CI; require test utilities to round-trip through the production serialization and parsing pipeline.

- **Meta**
  - Gate all future changes to the metadata block format on passing round-trip/deterministic serialization tests.
  - Ensure no mutation of the block during serialization and hashing steps.

- **Recommended Implementation Example**
  ```python
  def canonicalize_block(block_dict):
      # Remove/replace volatile fields
      for field in ["hash", "last_modified_at"]:
          if field in block_dict:
              block_dict[field] = "<PLACEHOLDER>"
      return yaml.dump(
          block_dict,
          sort_keys=True,
          default_flow_style=False,
          allow_unicode=True,
          explicit_start=True,
          explicit_end=True,
          Dumper=yaml.SafeDumper
      )
  ```
  - Use this function (or equivalent) before computing or verifying hash.

---

#### Assistant Follow-Up Suggestions (2025-05-19)

- **Hash Drift/Idempotency Failure**
  - After canonicalization and before serialization, deep-copy the metadata block and compare it post-hash to verify no in-place mutation occurs. Example:
    ```python
    import copy
    pre_hash = copy.deepcopy(block)
    # canonicalize/serialize/hash here
    assert pre_hash == block, "Block mutated during hash/serialization"
    ```
  - Canonicalization should recursively sanitize all fields, including nested dicts/lists, not just top-level replacements.
  - Add a round-trip invariant test: canonicalize/serialize → parse → canonicalize/serialize again → assert bitwise equality.
  - Confirm PyYAML version consistency in all environments. Use `yaml.SafeDumper` and enforce `sort_keys=True` in all YAML serialization utilities.

- **YAML Block Parsing Failures**
  - After comment prefix stripping, remove all lines exactly matching block delimiters (`=== OmniNode:Metadata ===` and `=== /OmniNode:Metadata ===`) regardless of their position.
    ```python
    delimiters = {"=== OmniNode:Metadata ===", "=== /OmniNode:Metadata ==="}
    yaml_lines = [line for line in stripped_lines if line.strip() not in delimiters]
    ```
  - Assert that no delimiters remain after extraction, and add a test that fails if any survive.

- **Test Utility Drift**
  - For all test stubs/utilities, add meta-tests that check for protocol compliance (presence of `model_dump` and Pydantic compatibility). Use `isinstance(test_stub, BaseModel)` or `hasattr(obj, "model_dump")`.

- **Integration Test Structure**
  - Extend integration tests to cover real-world, multi-field, nested metadata blocks, including nulls, empty lists, and nested dicts—these are common instability sources.

- **Defensive CI Gating**
  - Block merges or promotion of metadata-related changes unless round-trip and idempotency tests pass on at least three production-like block examples.

- **Sample Round-Trip Test**
    ```python
    def test_canonicalization_round_trip():
        original = {
            "field1": "value",
            "last_modified_at": "2025-05-18T00:00:00Z",
            "hash": "old_hash",
            "nested": {"foo": None, "bar": [1, 2]}
        }
        yaml_1 = canonicalize_block(original.copy())
        loaded = yaml.safe_load(yaml_1)
        yaml_2 = canonicalize_block(loaded)
        assert yaml_1 == yaml_2, "Round-trip canonicalization failed"
    ```
  - Replace `canonicalize_block` with the project's deterministic serializer. Fail build on any assertion failure.

#### Debug Entry: YAML Parsing Failure – Delimiter Handling in Block Extraction
- **Timestamp:** 2025-05-18T22:10:00Z
- **Engineer:** jonah
- **Tags:** [#blocker, #yaml, #idempotency, #parsing]
- **Context:**
  - Persistent idempotency/hash stability test failures traced to YAML parsing errors after repeated stamps.
  - Debug logs show that after comment prefix stripping, the YAML string being parsed still contains the block delimiters (`=== OmniNode:Metadata ===` and `=== /OmniNode:Metadata ===`), which is not valid YAML.

---

##### 1. Problem Statement
- The block extraction logic was intended to strip both the comment prefix and the block delimiters before YAML parsing, but the delimiters were not being removed correctly.
- The attempted fix checked for delimiters at the start/end of the string, but after stripping, the delimiters are on their own lines, not at the start/end.
- As a result, the YAML parser receives a string with delimiters, causing errors like `mapping values are not allowed here`.

##### 2. Initial Hypotheses
- The delimiter removal logic is insufficient because it does not account for delimiters on their own lines.
- Filtering out lines that exactly match the delimiters after comment prefix stripping should resolve the issue.

##### 3. Investigation Steps
- Added debug logging to print the YAML string being parsed and the result of `yaml.safe_load`.
- Observed that the delimiters are present in the YAML string, causing parsing to fail.
- Confirmed that the delimiters are not always at the start/end of the string, so the previous logic does not remove them.

##### 4. Observations
- The YAML string passed to the parser contains lines like `=== OmniNode:Metadata ===` and `=== /OmniNode:Metadata ===`.
- YAML interprets these as scalars, not mapping keys, resulting in parsing errors or `None`.
- The rest of the block is valid YAML, so removing these lines should allow parsing to succeed.

##### 5. Next Steps
- Patch the extraction logic to filter out any lines that match the delimiters after comment prefix stripping, so only the YAML mapping remains.
- Re-run the test suite to confirm that this resolves the idempotency/hash stability failures.
