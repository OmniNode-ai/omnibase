**Context:**  
ONEX ecosystem protocol-pure logging and event bus propagation refactor, focused on the Stamper Node and all related CLI, engine, handler, and test code. RIPER-10 mode discipline and ONEX standards enforced.

**Problem Statement:**  
Legacy and partial event bus propagation caused protocol purity errors (`emit_log_event requires an explicit event_bus argument`). These errors appeared in CLI, handler, engine, and test code, especially in directory traversal and handler instantiation paths.

**Hypotheses:**  
- Some code paths (especially legacy/fixture/test) were not propagating or instantiating `event_bus` correctly.
- Handler and registry instantiation in CLI and tests was not protocol-pure.
- DirectoryTraverser and engine code sometimes used a default or missing event bus.

**Investigation Steps:**  
- Systematic search for all `emit_log_event` calls and handler/engine instantiations.
- Refactored all relevant classes to require and propagate `event_bus`.
- Updated all CLI, engine, handler, and registry code to pass `event_bus` explicitly.
- Fixed test fixtures and mocks to ensure protocol-pure event bus propagation.
- Repeatedly ran the full test suite after each batch of changes.
- Fixed fixture loading and unit test mocks to avoid regressions.

**Findings:**  
- All protocol-pure logging and event bus propagation errors are now resolved.
- DirectoryTraverser is always instantiated with the correct event bus.
- Handler and registry instantiation is protocol-pure in all code paths.
- All CLI node parity, integration, and protocol-pure logging tests now pass.
- No regressions in fixture or unit test code.

**Next Steps:**  
- Push changes and open a PR for review.
- Monitor for any further protocol-purity regressions in future development.
- Continue enforcing RIPER-10 and ONEX standards in all protocol and logging code.

### Debug Entry: Schema Evolution Test KeyError (meta_type_project)
- **Timestamp:** 2025-05-31T20:49:37Z
- **Engineer:** jonahgabriel
- **Tags:** [#protocol_purity, #model_typing, #schema_evolution, #test, #KeyError, #onex, #riper10]
- **Context:**
  - Debugging protocol-pure model typing and schema evolution test failures, specifically KeyError for 'meta_type_project' in test_schema_evolution.py.

#### 1. Problem Statement
- Test `test_meta_type_evolution` in test_schema_evolution.py fails with KeyError: 'meta_type_project'.
- This occurs after adding an explicit test case for meta_type_project to the registry.

#### 2. Initial Hypotheses
- The test case is not being registered or is not present in the registry used by the test.
- There may be a mismatch between test parameterization and registry context (mock vs integration).
- The test may be using a filtered registry that omits the new test case.

#### 3. Investigation Steps
- Added explicit test case for meta_type_project using ProjectMetadataBlock fields.
- Confirmed registration logic and checked that the test case is present in the global registry.
- Inspected test parameterization and fixture logic for context switching.
- Verified that the test case is present in the integration context but not in the mock context.

#### 4. Observations
- KeyError persists in test_meta_type_evolution for 'meta_type_project'.
- The test case is present in the global registry but not in the mock context registry.
- Likely cause: mock context registry omits the new test case from its essential_cases list.

#### 5. Next Steps
- Update the mock context essential_cases list to include 'meta_type_project'.
- Rerun the test suite to confirm resolution.
- Review all registry-driven test parameterization for completeness and protocol-pure coverage.

### Context
- Working on ONEX Milestone 1: protocol-pure, strongly-typed refactor and enforcement.
- All protocol-pure logging, event emission, and handler typing refactor items are complete and checklist is up to date.
- Systematic review of all directories for typing violations is nearly complete.
- The checklist in `docs/milestones/milestone_1_checklist.md` is the source of truth for progress.
- Current focus: protocol/ directory, specifically files with legacy Any/Dict/tuple return types.

### Problem Statement
- Some protocol files still use legacy types (Any, Dict, tuple, etc.) in protocol-facing signatures.
- Need to finish refactoring these to use canonical models and enums, and update the checklist accordingly.
- Must ensure all protocol-facing interfaces are protocol-pure and strongly typed before closing Milestone 1.

### Hypotheses
- The remaining protocol files can be refactored to use canonical models without breaking compatibility.
- All required models and enums are already defined; only signatures and return types need updating.
- No major architectural blockers remain, only systematic refactoring and checklist updates.

### Investigation Steps
- Systematically reviewed all major directories: core/, enums/, handlers/, model/, fixtures/, mixin/ (all compliant).
- Identified 4 protocol files needing refactor: protocol_file_type_handler_registry.py (now fixed), protocol_validate.py, protocol_directory_traverser.py, protocol_schema_loader.py.
- Updated checklist to reflect partial review of protocol/ and note which files remain.
- Confirmed that all other directories are compliant and checklist is up to date.

### Findings
- ProtocolFileTypeHandlerRegistry is now protocol-pure and strongly typed.
- Remaining protocol files to refactor:
    - protocol_validate.py
    - protocol_directory_traverser.py
    - protocol_schema_loader.py
- No open blockers; just need to finish these files and update the checklist.
- All tests are passing for completed refactors; expect only minor test updates for remaining files.

### Next Steps
1. Refactor protocol_validate.py, protocol_directory_traverser.py, and protocol_schema_loader.py to use canonical models and enums for all protocol-facing signatures and return types.
2. Update any affected tests to use the new models/enums.
3. Mark protocol/ as fully reviewed and compliant in the checklist.
4. Run full test suite and resolve any remaining issues.
5. Prepare for final Milestone 1 review and transition to next milestone.

**Resume here next session: begin with protocol_validate.py refactor.**
