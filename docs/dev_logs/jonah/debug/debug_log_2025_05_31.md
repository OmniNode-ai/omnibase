**Context:**  
ONEX ecosystem protocol-pure logging and event bus propagation refactor, focused on the Stamper Node and all related CLI, engine, handler, and test code. RIPER-10 mode discipline and ONEX standards enforced.

**Problem Statement:**  
Legacy and partial event bus propagation caused protocol purity errors (`emit_log_event requires an explicit event_bus argument`). These errors appeared in CLI, handler, engine, and test code, especially in directory traversal and handler instantiation paths.

**Hypotheses:**  
- Some code paths (especially legacy/fixture/test) were not propagating or instantiating `event_bus` correctly.
- Handler and registry instantiation in CLI and tests was not protocol-pure.
- DirectoryTraverser and engine code sometimes used a default or missing event bus.

**Investigation Steps:**  
- Systematic search for all `emit_log_event` calls and handler/engine instantiations.
- Refactored all relevant classes to require and propagate `event_bus`.
- Updated all CLI, engine, handler, and registry code to pass `event_bus` explicitly.
- Fixed test fixtures and mocks to ensure protocol-pure event bus propagation.
- Repeatedly ran the full test suite after each batch of changes.
- Fixed fixture loading and unit test mocks to avoid regressions.

**Findings:**  
- All protocol-pure logging and event bus propagation errors are now resolved.
- DirectoryTraverser is always instantiated with the correct event bus.
- Handler and registry instantiation is protocol-pure in all code paths.
- All CLI node parity, integration, and protocol-pure logging tests now pass.
- No regressions in fixture or unit test code.

**Next Steps:**  
- Push changes and open a PR for review.
- Monitor for any further protocol-purity regressions in future development.
- Continue enforcing RIPER-10 and ONEX standards in all protocol and logging code.
