# Debug Log for 2025-05-22

## Daily Summary
### Suggestions
- Reference specific issue or ticket IDs for handler/fixture separation to improve traceability. See [Issue #123](https://github.com/omnibase/onex/issues/123) (placeholder).
- Include a link or citation to [`docs/testing.md`](../../../../testing.md) where delimiter and serialization standards are defined.
- Add a CI status badge or note indicating the current compliance state of the node-local test suite. **Current Status:** ![CI](https://github.com/omnibase/onex/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg) (passing as of 2025-05-22).
- Cross-reference the fixture/integration separation checklist with the canonical metadata block specification in [`docs/testing/fixtures_guidelines.md`](../../../../testing/fixtures_guidelines.md) and [`docs/nodes/structural_conventions.md`](../../../../nodes/structural_conventions.md).

- Focused on debugging ONEX node-local test registry and handler serialization/extraction compliance. Addressed issues with handler delimiter usage, YAML block round-tripping, and standards enforcement in test case generation. Ensured all test cases and handlers are protocol-driven, registry-injected, and standards-compliant. Next steps: finalize handler/fixture/integration test separation and CI enforcement.

## Debug Entries

### Debug Entry: Handler/Test Registry/Standards Compliance in ONEX Node-Local Tests
- **Timestamp:** 2025-05-22T00:00:00Z
- **Engineer:** jonah
- **Tags:** #node, #handler, #test, #standards, #protocol, #debug
- **Context:**
  - Debugging persistent failures in ONEX node-local tests related to handler serialization, delimiter usage, and registry-driven test case compliance. Ensuring all test cases are generated via canonical handlers and all delimiters/constants are imported, not hardcoded.

#### 1. Problem Statement
- Node-local tests for the stamper node were failing due to mismatches between handler serialization and extraction logic, improper delimiter usage, and non-standards-compliant test case construction (e.g., string literals instead of handler-generated blocks).

#### 2. Initial Hypotheses
- Handlers were hardcoding delimiters and field names instead of using canonical constants.
- Test registry was generating file content with string literals, not using handler serialization.
- Extraction logic was not symmetric with serialization, causing round-trip parse failures.
- Enum values were not being converted to strings before YAML serialization, causing PyYAML errors.

#### 3. Investigation Steps
- Audited all handler serialize_block and extract_block logic for delimiter and YAML block handling.
- Refactored handlers to use only imported constants for delimiters and to serialize the entire metadata block as a single YAML object.
- Updated test registry to generate all test case file_content via handler.serialize_block(meta_block), not by hand.
- Ensured all Enums are converted to strings before YAML serialization.
- Patched extraction logic to parse the block as a single YAML object, not per-line comments.
- Ran full test suite after each change to confirm round-trip parseability and standards compliance.

#### 4. Observations
- Handlers now produce and extract round-trip parseable YAML blocks, with delimiters on their own lines and no string literals.
- Test registry is fully protocol-driven and registry-injected; all test cases are handler-generated.
- Tests pass for all canonical file types (YAML, Markdown, Python) in the node-local registry-driven suite.
- Remaining issues are limited to fixture/integration test separation and CI enforcement, not handler or registry logic.

#### 5. Next Steps & Suggestions
- Finalize handler/fixture/integration test separation per checklist and [`docs/testing.md`](../../../../testing.md).
- Add/expand handler-level and integration tests for file-based fixtures and CLI flows.
- Document rationale and separation in [`docs/testing/node_testing_guidelines.md`](../../../../testing/node_testing_guidelines.md) and [`docs/testing/fixtures_guidelines.md`](../../../../testing/fixtures_guidelines.md).
- Ensure all CI and lint checks pass for handler/registry/test compliance. See [CI Status](https://github.com/omnibase/onex/actions/workflows/ci.yml).
- Cross-reference the fixture/integration separation checklist with the canonical metadata block specification in [`docs/nodes/structural_conventions.md`](../../../../nodes/structural_conventions.md).
- Reference or open issues for any remaining separation or compliance work (see [Issue #123](https://github.com/omnibase/onex/issues/123)).
