#### Context
Debugging the YAML handler's idempotency logic for ONEX metadata stamping. The goal is to ensure that the `last_modified_at` and `hash` fields are only updated if the rest of the file (excluding the metadata block) changes. The handler uses a centralized mixin (`stamp_with_idempotency`) for this logic. Test failures persist due to microsecond-level churn in `last_modified_at` and hash, even when the file is unchanged.

#### Problem Statement
Despite refactoring to centralize idempotency logic, the test `test_compute_hash` fails: after stamping a file, a second stamp (with no content change) results in a different `last_modified_at` and hash, due to microsecond differences in the timestamp. This breaks true idempotency and causes test failures.

#### Hypotheses
- The `now` timestamp is always set to the current time when stamping, even if the file is unchanged, causing microsecond churn.
- The idempotency check is correct in principle (using hash and last_modified_at placeholders), but the update logic does not preserve the previous `last_modified_at` when the file is unchanged.
- The test expects the `last_modified_at` field to be exactly the same if the file is unchanged, but the implementation always generates a new timestamp for each stamp operation.

#### Investigation Steps
1. Reviewed the implementation of `stamp_with_idempotency` in `MetadataBlockMixin`.
2. Confirmed that the hash is computed with both `hash` and `last_modified_at` replaced by placeholders.
3. Observed that when stamping a new block, `last_modified_at` is always set to `now`, regardless of whether the file is dirty.
4. Ran the test suite repeatedly; each run showed a microsecond difference in `last_modified_at` and hash, even with no file changes.
5. Refactored the logic to only update `last_modified_at` if the rest of the file changes, but the bug persisted due to always passing a new `now` value.

#### Findings
- The root cause is that `last_modified_at` is always set to the current time (`now`) on every stamp, even if the file is unchanged.
- The idempotency check itself is correct, but the update logic must preserve the previous `last_modified_at` and `hash` if the file is unchanged.
- True idempotency requires that after the first stamp, subsequent stamps with no content change must preserve all metadata fields, including `last_modified_at` and `hash`.

#### Next Steps
- Refactor the logic so that after the first stamp, if the file is stamped again with no changes, the previous `last_modified_at` is preserved, not replaced with a new `now` value.
- Re-run the test suite to confirm that the fix achieves true idempotency for both `last_modified_at` and `hash`.
- Document this requirement in the handler and mixin docstrings for future maintainers.

#### Context
Re-tested the YAML handler after updating the idempotency logic in the metadata block mixin (line 79). The goal was to ensure that `last_modified_at` and `hash` are only updated if the rest of the file changes. Ran the test suite to validate the fix.

#### Problem Statement
Despite the update, the test `test_compute_hash` still fails: the `last_modified_at` field is updated with a new timestamp on every stamp, even when the file is unchanged. This results in persistent microsecond-level churn and breaks true idempotency.

#### Hypotheses
- The logic at line 79 is not effective because it still sets `last_modified_at` to `now` for every non-idempotent case, even if the only change is the timestamp itself.
- The test expects that after the first stamp, if the file is stamped again with no changes, the `last_modified_at` and `hash` fields are preserved exactly.

#### Investigation Steps
1. Reviewed the updated logic at line 79 in the mixin.
2. Ran the test suite; observed that the test still fails for the same reason as before.
3. Compared the `last_modified_at` values between consecutive stamps and confirmed microsecond-level differences.

#### Findings
- The intended fix (preserve `last_modified_at` and `hash` if the file is unchanged) is not achieved.
- The code still sets `last_modified_at` to `now` for every non-idempotent case, even if the only change is the timestamp.
- True idempotency is not achieved; the test continues to fail.

#### Next Steps
- Return to PLAN mode for a more robust patch to ensure that `last_modified_at` and `hash` are only updated if the rest of the file changes.
- Consider a more explicit separation of content change detection and metadata update logic.

#### Context
While testing the ONEX metadata stamping CLI, a runtime error was encountered: `'dict' object has no attribute 'model_dump'`. This occurred in the idempotency logic within the `MetadataBlockMixin`, which is responsible for ensuring that metadata fields are only updated if the file body changes. The error surfaced after recent refactoring to centralize idempotency and model-driven policy, and after resolving previous timestamp/idempotency bugs.

#### Problem Statement
The stamping pipeline sometimes attempts to call `.model_dump()` on a `dict` instead of a `NodeMetadataBlock` model instance. This breaks the stamping process and violates the project's typing and protocol standards, which require all protocol methods to use the strongest possible typing and return models, not dicts.

#### Hypotheses
- Some handler or mixin code paths return a `dict` instead of a `NodeMetadataBlock` model, especially after extracting or constructing metadata blocks.
- The type confusion is not always caught by static typing due to dynamic construction or legacy code paths.
- The error is triggered when the CLI or test suite passes a dict to a code path expecting a model, leading to the missing `.model_dump()` method.

#### Investigation Steps
1. Reviewed all `.model_dump()` calls in `MetadataBlockMixin` and related handlers.
2. Added debug logging to print the type of objects before calling `.model_dump()`.
3. Identified that in some cases, especially after extracting or copying metadata, a dict is passed instead of a model.
4. Cross-referenced with the `typing_and_protocols` rule, which mandates model usage for all protocol methods and return values.

#### Findings
- The root cause is inconsistent type handling: dicts are sometimes returned or passed where a `NodeMetadataBlock` model is required.
- This violates the `typing_and_protocols` rule and leads to runtime errors when model methods are called on dicts.
- The issue is most likely to occur after extraction, copying, or handler return values that do not enforce model instantiation.

#### Next Steps
- Refactor all relevant code paths to ensure that only `NodeMetadataBlock` instances are passed to `.model_dump()` and other model methods.
- Add explicit type checks and conversions before calling `.model_dump()`.
- Add debug logging to record when a dict is converted to a model, for future maintainability.
- Ensure all handler and utility return values are models, not dicts, per the `typing_and_protocols` rule.
- Re-run the CLI and test suite to confirm the bug is fixed and no new issues are introduced.
