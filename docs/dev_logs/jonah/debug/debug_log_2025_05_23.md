# Debug Log – 2025-05-23

## [2025-05-23T<fill-timestamp>] – Investigation: .github/workflows/ci.yml restamping in pre-commit

**Engineer:** jonah
**Tags:** #debug #stamper #ignore #regression #ci

### Context
- The ONEX stamper is restamping `.github/workflows/ci.yml` during pre-commit, even though `.github/.onexignore` specifies that all files in `.github/` should be ignored.
- This behavior is not observed when running the stamper manually in directory mode; only in pre-commit (file mode).

### Problem Statement
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` should be ignored by the stamper in all contexts, but is not being ignored in pre-commit runs.

### Hypotheses
1. The ignore logic is not loading `.onexignore` from the correct directory when invoked in file mode.
2. The ignore pattern loading does not walk up parent directories, so `.github/.onexignore` is missed.
3. There is a difference in working directory or invocation context between manual and pre-commit runs.

### Investigation Steps
- Confirmed `.github/.onexignore` exists and contains the correct pattern (`- "*"`).
- Ran pre-commit and observed that `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is still restamped.
- Reviewed the ignore logic in `directory_traverser.py` and found it previously only checked the file's own directory.
- Updated `load_ignore_patterns` to walk up parent directories to the repo root, merging all `.onexignore` patterns.
- Re-ran pre-commit; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is still being restamped.
- Inspected debug logs: confirmed ignore patterns are not being loaded for files in `.github/` during pre-commit.
- Manually checked the state of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` after pre-commit: metadata block is present (restamped).

### Findings
- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: `StamperEngine.load_onexignore()` only checked the specific directory provided, not parent directories.
- For `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the CLI called `engine.load_onexignore(file_path.parent)` which only looked in `.github/workflows/`, not `.github/` where the `.onexignore` file exists.
- `DirectoryTraverser.load_ignore_patterns()` was correctly updated to walk parent directories, but `StamperEngine` had its own separate implementation that didn't use this functionality.

### Fix Implementation
- **Updated `StamperEngine.load_onexignore()`** to delegate to `DirectoryTraverser.load_ignore_patterns()` instead of implementing its own directory-specific logic.
- This ensures parent directory traversal is used consistently in both file and directory mode.

### Verification Results
- **Manual test**: `poetry run onex stamp file .github/workflows/ci.yml` now correctly skips the file due to `.github/.onexignore` patterns.
- **Pre-commit test**: `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files` shows `ONEX Metadata Stamper....Passed` without restamping `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **Git status**: No metadata block added to `ci.yml`, confirming the fix works.

### Resolution Status
✅ **RESOLVED**: The `.onexignore` file mode bug has been fixed and verified working in both manual and pre-commit contexts.

### Next Steps
- Add granular debug logging to the ignore pattern loading and matching for files in `.github/` during pre-commit.
- Confirm the working directory and invocation context for the stamper in pre-commit.
- Patch the ignore logic if necessary to ensure `.onexignore` is always loaded for files in subdirectories, even in file mode.
- Re-test and update the debug log with results.
