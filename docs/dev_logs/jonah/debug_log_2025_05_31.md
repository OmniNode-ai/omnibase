### Context
- Working on ONEX Milestone 1: protocol-pure, strongly-typed refactor and enforcement.
- All protocol-pure logging, event emission, and handler typing refactor items are complete and checklist is up to date.
- Systematic review of all directories for typing violations is nearly complete.
- The checklist in `docs/milestones/milestone_1_checklist.md` is the source of truth for progress.
- Current focus: protocol/ directory, specifically files with legacy Any/Dict/tuple return types.

### Problem Statement
- Some protocol files still use legacy types (Any, Dict, tuple, etc.) in protocol-facing signatures.
- Need to finish refactoring these to use canonical models and enums, and update the checklist accordingly.
- Must ensure all protocol-facing interfaces are protocol-pure and strongly typed before closing Milestone 1.

### Hypotheses
- The remaining protocol files can be refactored to use canonical models without breaking compatibility.
- All required models and enums are already defined; only signatures and return types need updating.
- No major architectural blockers remain, only systematic refactoring and checklist updates.

### Investigation Steps
- Systematically reviewed all major directories: core/, enums/, handlers/, model/, fixtures/, mixin/ (all compliant).
- Identified 4 protocol files needing refactor: protocol_file_type_handler_registry.py (now fixed), protocol_validate.py, protocol_directory_traverser.py, protocol_schema_loader.py.
- Updated checklist to reflect partial review of protocol/ and note which files remain.
- Confirmed that all other directories are compliant and checklist is up to date.

### Findings
- ProtocolFileTypeHandlerRegistry is now protocol-pure and strongly typed.
- Remaining protocol files to refactor:
    - protocol_validate.py
    - protocol_directory_traverser.py
    - protocol_schema_loader.py
- No open blockers; just need to finish these files and update the checklist.
- All tests are passing for completed refactors; expect only minor test updates for remaining files.

### Next Steps
1. Refactor protocol_validate.py, protocol_directory_traverser.py, and protocol_schema_loader.py to use canonical models and enums for all protocol-facing signatures and return types.
2. Update any affected tests to use the new models/enums.
3. Mark protocol/ as fully reviewed and compliant in the checklist.
4. Run full test suite and resolve any remaining issues.
5. Prepare for final Milestone 1 review and transition to next milestone.

**Resume here next session: begin with protocol_validate.py refactor.**
