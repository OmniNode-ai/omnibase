- **Branch:** feat-milestone-1-onextree-registry-2025-05-24 ‚Üí main
- **PR ID or Link:** #21

## Summary of Changes
Comprehensive implementation of Milestone 1 critical path requirements including registry-centric versioned artifact layout, .onextree manifest system, OnexRegistryLoader with protocol compliance, compatibility metadata, and complete migration documentation.

## Key Achievements
### Registry Architecture & Loader
- Implemented complete OnexRegistryLoader with ProtocolRegistry interface compliance
- Added comprehensive registry-driven artifact discovery and validation
- Implemented .wip marker support for work-in-progress artifacts

- Created extensive test coverage with 36 passing tests (mock and integration)

### .onextree Manifest System
- Implemented complete .onextree manifest generation and validation
- Added tree generator node with 274-line engine and comprehensive validation
- Integrated .onextree validation into CI and pre-commit hooks
- Added onextree validator tool with detailed error reporting

### Versioned Artifact Structure
- Migrated all artifacts to registry-centric versioned directories (vX_Y_Z format)
- Created comprehensive template node with .onexignore for development workflow
- Added versioned CLI tools, runtimes, and node structures
- Implemented proper import path management for versioned artifacts

### Compatibility Metadata
- Added semantic version ranges to all artifact metadata files
- Implemented compatibility validation in registry loader
- Added platform, runtime, and API version compatibility tracking
- Created comprehensive compatibility test coverage

### Documentation & Migration
- Added extensive migration notes with before/after examples
- Updated registry architecture documentation with 400+ lines of guidance
- Created step-by-step migration procedures and common pitfall solutions
- Added rollback strategies and future considerations

### CI & Quality Assurance
- Integrated comprehensive pre-commit hooks (stamper, tree generator, validator)
- Added CI enforcement for .onextree synchronization
- Implemented yamllint, mypy, black, ruff, and isort validation
- All 36 registry tests passing with full protocol compliance

## File-by-File Impact (Optional)
- **docs/registry_architecture.md**: +416 lines of comprehensive documentation and migration guidance
- **src/omnibase/core/onex_registry_loader.py**: +539 lines implementing complete registry loader
