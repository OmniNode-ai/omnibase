# Refactor ONEX Metadata Stamper: Idempotency, Sticky Field Preservation, and Protocol Compliance

- **Branch:** feat-stamper_cli_fix â†’ main
- **PR ID or Link:** 18 (https://github.com/OmniNode-ai/omnibase/pull/18)

## Summary of Changes
This PR refactors the ONEX Metadata Stamper for full idempotency, sticky field preservation, and strict protocol compliance. All stamping logic is centralized, handlers are protocol-driven, and all tests and pre-commit hooks pass.

## Key Achievements
- **Stamper/Engine:**
  - Centralized all stamping/idempotency logic in `MetadataBlockMixin.update_metadata_block`
  - Engine delegates stamping to handlers; handlers use only the mixin
  - Sticky fields (`created_at`, `uuid`) are preserved; idempotency is enforced
  - Removed duplication and legacy logic from engine and handlers
- **Testing & Quality:**
  - All tests pass (`pytest`, `mypy`, `ruff`, `black`, `isort`)
  - Added/updated idempotency and handler tests
  - Pre-commit workflow is robust and non-looping
- **Documentation:**
  - Updated design docs and architecture diagrams for new stamping flow
  - PR description and template updated for standards compliance
- **Interface & Typing:**
  - All interfaces use `Protocol` or `ABC` as per project rules
  - All protocol methods use Pydantic models and Enums for arguments/returns
