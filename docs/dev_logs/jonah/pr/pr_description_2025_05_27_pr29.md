# Complete YAML Compliance and Structured Logging Infrastructure

- **Branch:** feat-replace-logging → main
- **PR ID or Link:** #29

## Summary of Changes
This PR achieves 100% YAML compliance across the entire codebase and completes the structured logging infrastructure implementation. It includes comprehensive YAML toolchain development, complete CLI node implementation with event-driven architecture, and systematic fixes for all YAML formatting issues.

## Key Achievements

**YAML Infrastructure & Compliance:**
- ✅ Achieved 100% YAML compliance (0 yamllint errors across entire codebase)
- ✅ Fixed root cause: StateContractHandler YAML indentation issues
- ✅ Built comprehensive 4-script YAML fixing toolchain (1,234 lines)
- ✅ Updated pre-commit configuration to exclude contract.yaml files from regular stamping
- ✅ Created systematic issue tracking and root cause analysis system

**Structured Logging Implementation:**
- ✅ Complete removal of all Python `logging` module usage from production code
- ✅ Replaced all `print()` statements with `emit_log_event()` calls
- ✅ Eliminated all logging compatibility layers and bridges
- ✅ Enforced that ALL logging flows through the Logger Node
- ✅ Refactored TelemetrySubscriber to work purely with event bus

**CLI Node Development:**
- ✅ Complete CLI node implementation with event-driven architecture (2,060 lines)
- ✅ Command routing and node discovery system
- ✅ Comprehensive introspection and state management
- ✅ Full integration with ONEX ecosystem
- ✅ CLI parity validation system implementation

**Node Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Complete docstring generator node with ONEX architecture compliance
- ✅ All nodes updated with proper contract.yaml files
- ✅ Centralized enum definitions for better maintainability
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite reorganization to centralized tests/ structure

**System Architecture:**
- ✅ Entire codebase migrated to pathlib.Path objects (183 files)
- ✅ Protocol file organization and naming convention compliance
- ✅ Enhanced type safety and path handling throughout

## Metrics
- **Files Changed:** 305
- **Lines Added:** 21,102
- **Lines Removed:** 3,648
- **Lines Changed:** +21,102 / -3,648
- **Time Spent:** 2 days

## Compliance & Quality
- ✅ All 637 tests passing, 32 skipped (100% pass rate)
- ✅ 0 YAML errors (yamllint compliance achieved)
- ✅ All Python code quality checks passing (ruff, mypy, black, isort)
- ✅ All ONEX ecosystem validations passing
- ✅ 19x performance improvement in CLI parity tests
- ✅ All pre-commit hooks operational

## Reviewer Notes
- Focus on the StateContractHandler YAML indentation fix as the root cause solution
- Review the comprehensive YAML toolchain for future maintenance
- Verify CLI node event-driven architecture integration
- Check structured logging centralization through Logger Node
