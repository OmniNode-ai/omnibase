- **Files Modified:** 39
- **Time Spent:** 1 day
- **Velocity Metric:** High - Significant milestone progress with schema loading and test architecture

### Key Achievements

#### Schema Loading & Validation
- Implemented `SchemaLoader` class in `schema/loader.py` implementing `ProtocolSchemaLoader`
- Added robust methods for loading YAML and JSON schema files with strong typing
- Created recursive discovery of schemas with graceful error handling for malformed files
- Fixed YAML syntax errors in schema files (escaping regex patterns)
- Created Pydantic models for metadata (`MetadataBlockModel`) and schemas (`SchemaModel`)

#### Registry & Test Architecture
- Created canonical test pattern in `tests/core/test_registry.py` using class-based tests
- Implemented registry fixture in `conftest.py` that swaps between mock and real implementations
- Added `@runtime_checkable` to protocols to enable `isinstance` checks
- Created `ProtocolTestableRegistry` interface for testing registry implementations
- Added type-aware model comparison helper for testing nested Pydantic models
- Made tests context-agnostic to support both unit and integration scenarios

#### Error Handling
- Created `OmniBaseError` base class in `src/omnibase/core/errors.py`
- Implemented consistent error handling across loaders and tests
- Added proper file path handling using `pathlib.Path` objects throughout
- Fixed Pydantic warnings by renaming shadowed fields and using `model_fields` correctly

#### Utils & Helpers
- Created `extract_example_from_schema` utility in `utils/yaml_extractor.py`
- Enabled DRY testing by reusing schema examples instead of duplicating test data
- Created type-aware model-vs-dict comparison helper for validation
- Enhanced output formatting for test fixtures
