## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 0.9.x to 1.0.0

#### Breaking Changes
1. **CLI Command Changes**: Commands have been updated from `omnibase` to `onex`
2. **Protocol Migration**: ABC-based interfaces replaced with Protocol classes
3. **Configuration Format**: Configuration schema has been updated
4. **Error Handling**: Error response format has been standardized

#### Migration Steps
1. **Update CLI Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Old
   omnibase run node_name
   
   # New
   onex run node_name
   ```

2. **Update Protocol Implementations**:
   ```python
   # Old (ABC-based)
   from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
   
   class NodeInterface(ABC):
       @abstractmethod
       def execute(self, context):
           pass
   
   # New (Protocol-based)
   from typing import Protocol
   
   class NodeProtocol(Protocol):
       def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> Result:
           ...
   ```

3. **Update Configuration Files**:
   - Review and update configuration files to match new schema
   - Use `onex validate` to check configuration validity

4. **Update Error Handling**:
   ```python
   # Old
   return {"status": "error", "message": "Something went wrong"}
   
   # New
   return UnifiedResultModel(
       status="error",
       messages=[OnexMessageModel(
           summary="Something went wrong",
           level="error"
       )]
