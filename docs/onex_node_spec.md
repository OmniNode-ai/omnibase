# ONEX Node Specification and Linking Model

> **Status:** Canonical Draft  
> **Last Updated:** 2025-05-18  
> **Purpose:** Define the complete `.onex` node schema, linking model, URI format, trust and validation metadata, and the structure and behavior required for ONEX node discoverability, execution, and interconnectivity.  
> **Audience:** Node authors, tool builders, runtime developers, CI engineers

---

## üß± What is an ONEX Node?

An ONEX node is a self-contained, declarative, executable unit defined by a `.onex` metadata file. Nodes are:
- Discoverable via `.tree` or registry
- Executable via a defined `entrypoint`
- Validated against schemas and CI rules
- Composable via `dependencies`, `protocols_supported`, and `base_class`
- Rated via a trust score stub
- Interoperable with ONEX runtimes and agents

---

## üìÑ Canonical `.onex` Metadata Schema

Each node has a `node.onex.yaml` file located in its top-level directory.

```yaml
# node.onex.yaml (example)
schema_version: "0.1.0"
name: "extract_summary_block"
version: "1.0.0"

```

## Protocol-Driven Stamping and Metadata Validation

- The ONEX Metadata Stamper is implemented as a protocol-driven, fixture-injectable engine. It injects and validates metadata blocks in `.onex` files according to the canonical schema above.
- All stamping and validation logic is defined by Python Protocols, enabling extensibility, testability, and context-agnostic execution.
- The stamper engine ensures that all required fields, formats, and schema constraints are enforced for every node.
- All dependencies (file I/O, ignore pattern sources, etc.) are injected via constructor or fixture, never hardcoded.
- The protocol-driven design enables registry-driven, context-agnostic validation and stamping in CI, pre-commit, and developer workflows.
- See [docs/protocols.md](../protocols.md), [docs/tools/stamper.md](../tools/stamper.md), and [docs/testing.md](../testing.md) for details on protocol-driven stamping and validation.

## üîó Canonical Linking Fields

### M1 Fields (Current)

| Field             | Type     | Description                                            |
|------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `dependencies`    | list     | Other nodes this node requires at runtime             |
| `base_class`      | list     | Interface or abstract class this node adheres to      |
| `protocols_supported` | list | Protocols or standards this node conforms to          |

These fields **must use a standardized URI format** (see below).

---

## üåê URI Format for Linking Fields

### Canonical Format

```
<type>://<namespace>@<version_spec>
```

- `<type>`: `tool`, `validator`, `agent`, `model`, `schema`, `plugin`
- `<namespace>`: Dot-delimited identifier (e.g. `core.schema_validator`)
- `<version_spec>`: Semver or constraint (e.g. `1.0.0`, `>=0.2.0`)

### Examples

```yaml
dependencies:
  - tool://tools.tree_generator@>=0.2.0
  - validator://core.schema_validator@1.0.0
base_class:
  - validator://core.base@^1.0
```

---

## üì¶ File Layout (Recommended)

Each node should be self-contained in its own directory, named to match the `name` in the `.onex`.

```
extract_summary_block/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node.onex.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ omnibase/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cli_extract_summary_block.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_extract_summary_block.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

This layout:
- Ensures tooling and CI can discover node boundaries
- Matches `.tree` generation
- Keeps implementation, metadata, and tests co-located

---

## üìú State Contract (Input/Output Interface)

The `state_contract` field links to a JSON Schema file that defines the node's expected input/output shape. Example:

```json
{
  "title": "SummaryBlockState",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "summary": { "type": "string" },
    "status": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["summary", "status"]
}
```

- File is referenced via `state_contract: "state_contract://summary_block_schema.json"`
- Schema lives under `src/omnibase/schema/schemas/`
- Used for both runtime validation and CI enforcement

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Rules

Milestone 1 CI must enforce:

- All `.onex` files must pass schema validation (`onex_node.yaml`)
- `uuid` must be a valid v4 UUID
- `hash` must match file hash of `node.onex.yaml`
- `lifecycle` must be one of: `draft`, `active`, `deprecated`, `archived`
- `.tree` file must reference this node correctly
- `entrypoint.target` must exist and be executable

Optional (Stretch):
- Signature block validation
- Trust score consistency across executions
- URI parsing and dereferencing for dependency validation

---

## üîê Trust and Signature Fields

Optional, planned for M3/M4:

- `trust_score_stub` records execution history
- `signature_block` enables cryptographic verification of the node metadata

---

## üîß Templates and Node Scaffolding

ONEX will support generation of nodes via reusable templates:

- Templates reside in `src/omnibase/templates/`
- Scaffold nodes (coming in Milestone 2) will generate compliant `.onex`, source, and test files

---

## üìÅ .tree Discovery Format

Each project or container should have a top-level `.tree` file that enumerates valid nodes. Example:

```yaml
nodes:
  - name: extract_summary_block
    path: extract_summary_block/node.onex.yaml
  - name: validate_tree_file
    path: tree_validator/node.onex.yaml
```

## üß≠ Future Work

| Proposed Field     | Purpose                                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `consumes`         | Declares what formats or data types this node reads                |
| `produces`         | Declares what formats or data types this node emits                |
| `compatible_with`  | Links nodes that can be safely chained (based on state_contract)   |
| `fork_of`          | Declares this node as a fork/derivative of another node            |
| `generated_by`     | Links the tool or node that scaffolded/generated this node         |

- These fields are optional in the current schema but may be added as extensions or in a schema upgrade (v0.2+).
- Validation rules and CI enforcement for them will be introduced in Milestone 3 or later.

---

## üîÅ Schema Extension Strategy

- All schemas must include `schema_version`
- Additive fields allowed in minor versions
- Breaking changes require new schema version
- x-prefixed fields (`x-extensions`) are always ignored by validators and can be used for node-local metadata

---
