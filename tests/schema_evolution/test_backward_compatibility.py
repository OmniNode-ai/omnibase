"""
Standards-Compliant Test File for ONEX/OmniBase Schema Evolution Backward Compatibility

This file should follow the canonical test pattern as demonstrated in tests/utils/test_node_metadata_extractor.py. It should demonstrate:
- Naming conventions: test_ prefix, lowercase, descriptive
- Context-agnostic, registry-driven, fixture-injected testing
- Use of both mock (unit) and integration (real) contexts via pytest fixture parametrization
- No global state; all dependencies are injected
- Compliance with all standards in docs/standards.md and docs/testing.md

All new schema evolution tests should follow this pattern unless a justified exception is documented and reviewed.
